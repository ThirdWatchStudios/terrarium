/**
 * The org-structure export artifact (Epic 2, F2.2 + F2.3) — `org-structure.json`,
 * the loadable shape the sim renders as a known-structure, fogged-contents org
 * chart.
 *
 * The load-bearing idea (S2.2.2) is a clean **structure / contents split**:
 *   - `structure` — what the player always sees: which departments exist, their
 *     labels + categories. The sim can load this alone to draw the chart.
 *   - `contents` — what the sim fogs until a wing is reached: who is inside each
 *     department (members), the reporting lines, and the department heads.
 *
 * **Reporting lines are DERIVED, not authored (F2.3 decision).** The source of
 * truth is the existing `manager` / `direct-report` relationship edges (§3.7) —
 * no parallel authoring surface. `manager` means *the holder reports to the
 * target*; `direct-report` means *the target reports to the holder*. The
 * department **head** is the topmost member (one with no manager inside the
 * department), seniority-tiebroken — so every populated department resolves a
 * head even before any reporting edge is authored (the company cascade or the
 * author can add edges to sharpen it).
 *
 * The artifact is derived, not stored — the company cascade (Epic 0 F0.3)
 * populates the same catalog + personas this reads. Membership resolves each
 * persona's free-text `department` via the F2.1 catalog mapping (the id-rewrite
 * is F3.1); unresolved personas land in `unassigned`.
