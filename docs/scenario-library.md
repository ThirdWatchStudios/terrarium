# Scenario Library — proposed standard templates

**Status: DRAFT for discussion.** The well of cast-agnostic scenario templates to draw
from, organized into **families** (a free-text `family` grouping on each template).
Only **The Office Romance** is built as content; the model supports every "ready" entry.
Lines are intentionally compact — preconditions are the design content; Seed/Steer get
fleshed out when each is authored.

- **Model:** `src/core/scenarioTemplate.ts` — role slots + preconditions + seed +
  emotional payload, cast onto whoever fits. See `docs/scenario-template-model.md` §3,
  `CONTRACT.md` §3.8. Design source: `scenario_model.md` + `player_goal_system.md`.
- **Precondition vocab** (reuse existing catalogs only): `trait`, `axis` (OCEAN +
  ambition/integrity/loyalty/discretion + temper/grudgeHolding), `need`, `drive`,
  `relationship` (pairwise-to-a-role), `aggregate` (a rel axis reduced across the whole
  cast). Proximity == `familiarity`. Roles: `present` (default) or `absent` (resolved +
  referenced, kept off-scene, reported as "the one to remove").

**Legend** — **BUILT** · ▶ recommended build-first · ★ fills a payload gap ·
⚑ needs model/sim work *(dep)* · roles tagged `(req)`/`(opt)`/`(absent)`. Format:
`Name — roles(preconditions) → payload · distinguisher`.

# Recommended build-first wave (▶)

All ready now; spans families, both primary engines, and showcases the new model features:
1. ~~**The Contested Promotion** (`rumor`)~~ — **BUILT** (`the_contested_promotion`); the decoupling worked example.
2. **The Love Triangle** (`attraction`) — the `thirdParty` jealousy coupling.
3. **The Outsider** (`belonging`) — the new `aggregate` precondition.
4. **The Scapegoat** (`blame`) — the new `absent` role.
5. **The Betrayal** (`rivalry`) — a provoke-first political relationship template.
6. **The Departure** (`belonging`) — broadens payload into grief/abandonment.

# Chains — "the office continues forward"

Chains are **emergent, not scripted**: the persistent cast + the sim's evolving state mean a
*resolved* scenario changes who qualifies next (Promotion Rumor → Carl exposed → Scapegoat →
Departure → Power Vacuum), with no branch tree authored. Resist hand-authoring chains. Optional
advisory `enables`/`follows` template hints (gap #7) could aid IRIS pacing + designer legibility
without scripting branches.

# Model / vocabulary gaps

1. ~~Aggregate ("to-everyone") preconditions~~ — **DONE** (`kind:'aggregate'`).
2. ~~Absent / negative roles~~ — **DONE** (`presence:'absent'`).
3. **History / event preconditions** — "recently failed / slighted / declining / demoted."
   Unqueryable today (lives in `formativeEvents` + runtime). **The whole `lifecycle` family
   needs this**, and it's where persistent-cast investment pays off. Upgraded from "skip" to
   "wanted." **Open.**
4. **Skill preconditions** — `kind:'skill'` (skill id + threshold). Credit Theft, Con, Enforcer,
   Impostor, Ramp Failure lean on it; all authorable without it for now. **Open.**
5. **Group / ensemble roles** — one slot → many agents (Clique, Witch Hunt, Coup, crowds/audiences).
   Option (a) add `count`/`min`/`max` to a role; (b) model crowds as an `aggregate` *condition on
   named principals* and don't cast the crowd. Leaning (b). **Open.**
6. **Shared intervention / "lever" catalog** (the Chekhov's-gun substrate) — generic move
   primitives the player fires, that templates bind + flavor. *Tabled by Tom — revisit.*
7. **Successor / chain hints** — advisory `enables`/`follows` on a template (not scripted
   branching). Low-cost. **Open.**

# Payload coverage

| Payload | Covered by |
|---|---|
| jealousy / rivalry | Romance, Love Triangle, Favorite, Feud, Work-Spouse |
| resentment / injustice | Contested Promotion, Credit Theft, Favorite, Scapegoat, Free Rider |
| betrayal | Betrayal, Whistleblower, Con, Double Agent, Coup |
| fear / paranoia | Layoff Scare, Scapegoat, Frame, Open-Plan Exposure, Witch Hunt |
| shame / guilt | Secret, Mentor's Disappointment, Bribe, Cover-Up |
| **humiliation / embarrassment** | Public Failure, Demotion, Unrequited Crush, Hypocrite |
| **contempt** | Bribe, Hypocrite, Perfectionist Bottleneck |
| grief / loneliness | Departure, Outsider, Grief Spotlight, False Friend, Last Straw |
| **pride / validation** | Viral Praise |
| vindication / smugness | Contested Promotion, Whistleblower, Credit Theft, Hypocrite |
| ambition / opportunism | Power Vacuum, Betrayal, Coup, Overpromiser |
| camaraderie / exploitation | Free Rider, Deadline Crunch, Outage, Hostile Handoff |
| obsolescence / disengagement | Overlooked Veteran, Training-Replacement, Recognition Drought |

Still thinnest on **awe/admiration** and **gratitude** — likely weak harvests; flag if wanted.

# Open questions

- `skill` precondition (gap #4): add, or author the few users on personality axes only?
- Group roles (gap #5): real ensemble roles, or aggregate-on-principals?
- Family granularity OK (14 families)? Candidate merges: `credit`↔`rumor`; `deception`↔`blame`;
  New Manager↔Contested Promotion as one family with variants.
- Cut line for ⚑ sim-gated entries (`territory`, time-based `productivity`, `lifecycle`): keep as a
  flagged backlog, or hold out until those systems exist?

  Chains section and gaps #5–#7; refreshed payload coverage.
