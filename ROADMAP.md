# Roadmap

Where the sprite toolkit goes next. Phases are ordered by dependency: each one
builds on the last, and items within a phase are roughly independent.

Current state (done): character compositor with anchors/tokens/silhouette
contracts, 6 mood overlays, 12 props with hybrid plan/elevation projection,
3 autotiling wall sets, 4 seamless floors, global style sheet, PNG + atlas
export at 1x/2x/4x, full-project zip.

---

## Phase 1 — See the game in the tool

### 1.1 Scene preview tab — DONE
A fourth canvas that composes floors + walls + props + characters into one
mock office screenshot, RimWorld-style hybrid projection rules applied
(floor layer → plan props → y-sorted elevation props and characters).
- Hand-place entities on a grid (click to stamp, right-click to clear).
- Mood selector per placed character — verify "suspicion spreading through
  the office" reads at game zoom before the game can show it.
- Export the scene as a poster PNG for art-direction review.
- **Why first:** every art decision so far has been judged one sprite at a
  time; the real test is sprites against each other in a room.

### 1.2 Random office layout generator — DONE
Implemented with: 22×14 grid, shared-edge room templates (never double walls),
comb-pattern cubicle farm (autotile partitions + desk/chair pods, coworkers
spawn seated), seeded RNG (same template+seed = same office, recorded in the
layout JSON), scene persisted in project state.
Generate plausible office layouts and furnish them automatically.
- Room-split (BSP or grid partition) into the game's named locations:
  reception, manager office, break room, conference room, cubicle farm,
  hallway.
- Per-room furnishing rules (break room gets fridge + coffee + water cooler;
  cubicle farm gets desk/chair/partition repeats; conference gets the table).
- Populate with the cast plus N random coworkers.
- Output: rendered scene **and** a layout JSON (grid of floor ids, wall
  cells, prop placements with rotation, character spawns) the game could
  consume directly later.
- Depends on 1.1 for rendering.

### 1.3 Style presets
Named, saveable style sheets ("Warm office", "Corporate cold", "High-contrast
readability") with one-click switching and a side-by-side compare view.
Cheap to build, and it's the payoff of the style-never-baked-into-parts rule.

### 1.4 Pixelate render mode
A style knob that re-renders everything chunky (render small, scale up with
nearest-neighbor). Settles the smooth-vector vs pixel-art question with a
slider instead of a debate. Touches only the exporter/preview, not parts.

---

## Phase 2 — Into Unity

### 2.1 Unity import helper (do this before any porting)
Editor script in The-Water-Cooler that ingests the export zip:
- Slices sheets using the atlas JSONs (frames, pivots).
- Applies projection metadata: plan props → center pivot, floor sorting
  layer, rotation allowed; elevation → base pivot, y-sorted.
- Builds RuleTiles (or a mask→sprite lookup) from wall tileset atlases.
- Generates prefabs per character/prop.
- **Why before the port:** pre-baked sprites + this importer may be all the
  game needs for a long time. The port is only urgent if runtime NPC
  generation is needed.

### 2.2 Runtime rendering decision (spike, ~a day)
The C# port has one open question: how to draw vector shapes in Unity.
Options to evaluate:
- **Unity VectorGraphics package** — parse the part SVGs directly, rasterize
  to textures at runtime. Closest to a straight port.
- **Shapes library** (already in the project) — render parts as immediate-mode
  vector draws; would constrain part paths to its primitives.
- **Pre-rasterized layer atlas** — bake each part variant to a texture once
  (in-tool), composite by stacking tinted quads in Unity. No vector code in
  C# at all; recipes + palette tints still give runtime variety.
The third option is likely the winner (simplest, fastest, mod-friendly), but
decide with a spike before committing.

### 2.3 C# compositor port
Port the data model + composite logic per the 2.2 decision: recipes, palette
token resolution, anchors, z-order, proportions, mood overlays. The outline
pass moves to a shader or stays baked depending on 2.2. Target API:
`SpriteSheet Compose(CharacterRecipe recipe, StyleSheet style)`.

### 2.4 Headless export CLI
`npm run export -- project.json out/` — regenerate every asset without the
browser (resvg-js or playwright for SVG→PNG). Lets the game's build pipeline
treat art as a compiled artifact of `project.json`, which is the whole point
of art-as-data.

## Phase 3 — Content depth & hardening

### 3.1 Remaining object taxonomy
- **Door** — special wall-slot tile (fits into a wall run, open/closed
  states); pairs with the badge reader.
- Window (wall-slot, like door), nameplate, HVAC vent, desk clutter
  (papers, phone), couch + rug (plan), vending machine (elevation).

### 3.2 Part library growth
More heads, hair, outfits (hoodie, suit jacket, dress), accessories (watch,
earbuds, clipboard). Carried-item overlays for characters (coffee run, stack
of papers) — same slot system, anchored at the hands.

### 3.3 Compositor snapshot tests
Golden-file tests (vitest): compose the cast + every part + all 16 wall masks
against committed SVG snapshots. The north-facing hair bug was exactly the
class of regression this catches — geometry helpers silently misbehaving for
inputs nobody eyeballed.

### 3.4 Atlas packing & texture hygiene
Single packed atlas option (everything in one texture with a JSON map),
1–2px bleed gutters for mipmapping/filtering, POT-sized outputs. Matters
once the game ships dozens of sheets.

### 3.5 Project schema versioning
The save format is patched ad-hoc (`??=` defaults). Before the game starts
consuming project.json, add a `version` bump + explicit migration steps so
old saves and the game's expectations can't drift apart.

## Explicitly out of scope (on purpose)

- **Frame animation** — the RimWorld slide-and-bob convention is a core scope
  decision, not a missing feature. Re-litigate only if playtests demand it.
- **In-tool game logic** (pathfinding, sim hooks) — the layout generator emits
  data; the game owns behavior.
- **Isometric projection** — would invalidate the part library; the top-down
  hybrid is settled.
