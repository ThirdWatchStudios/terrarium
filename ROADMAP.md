# Roadmap

Where the sprite toolkit goes next. Phases are ordered by dependency: each one
builds on the last, and items within a phase are roughly independent.

Current state (done): character compositor with anchors/tokens/silhouette
contracts, 6 mood overlays, 21 prop templates / 22 default prop instances with
hybrid plan/elevation projection and wall-slot placement metadata, 3
autotiling wall sets, 4 seamless floors, global style sheet, PNG + atlas export
at 1x/2x/4x, scene/layout JSON, full-project zip.

---

## Phase 1 — See the game in the tool

### 1.1 Scene preview tab — DONE
A fourth canvas that composes floors + walls + props + characters into one
mock office screenshot, RimWorld-style hybrid projection rules applied
(floor layer → plan props → y-sorted elevation props and characters).
- Hand-place entities on a grid (click to stamp, right-click to clear).
- Mood selector per placed character — verify "suspicion spreading through
  the office" reads at game zoom before the game can show it.
- Export the scene as a poster PNG for art-direction review.
- **Why first:** every art decision so far has been judged one sprite at a
  time; the real test is sprites against each other in a room.

### 1.2 Random office layout generator — DONE
Implemented with: 22×14 grid, shared-edge room templates (never double walls),
comb-pattern cubicle farm (autotile partitions + desk/chair pods, coworkers
spawn seated), seeded RNG (same template+seed = same office, recorded in the
layout JSON), scene persisted in project state.
Generate plausible office layouts and furnish them automatically.
- Room-split (BSP or grid partition) into the game's named locations:
  reception, manager office, break room, conference room, cubicle farm,
  hallway.
- Per-room furnishing rules (break room gets fridge + coffee + water cooler;
  cubicle farm gets desk/chair/partition repeats; conference gets the table).
- Populate with the cast plus N random coworkers.
- Output: rendered scene **and** a layout JSON (grid of floor ids, wall
  cells, prop placements with rotation, character spawns) the game could
  consume directly later.
- Depends on 1.1 for rendering.

### 1.3 Style presets — DONE
Implemented with: built-in "Warm office", "Corporate cold", and
"High-contrast readability" presets, project-persisted custom presets,
one-click apply/update/delete controls, and a compare view that renders the
current scene plus character strips side by side across styles.
Named, saveable style sheets ("Warm office", "Corporate cold", "High-contrast
readability") with one-click switching and a side-by-side compare view.
Cheap to build, and it's the payoff of the style-never-baked-into-parts rule.

### 1.4 Pixelate render mode — DONE
Implemented with: a project-persisted Style → Render pixelation slider, live
preview hints using crisp SVG edges, and PNG raster exports that render through
a smaller intermediate canvas before nearest-neighbor upscaling. Touches only
preview/export behavior; part definitions stay vector-smooth and unchanged.

---

## Phase 2 — Into Unity

### 2.1 Unity import helper — DONE (verified 2026-06-13)
Implemented in The-Water-Cooler with a Phase 2 editor menu importer:
`Water Cooler/Phase 2/Import Sprite Toolkit Zip...`. The importer extracts a
Sprite Character Creator export zip into a timestamped generated folder,
slices character/mood sheets and wall tilesets from atlas JSON, applies pivot
and projection metadata, builds character/prop prefabs, creates floor/prop/
character metadata assets, and uses a 16-mask wall sprite lookup instead of
RuleTiles until the map path needs a Tilemap dependency.

Cross-checked against `exporter.ts`: folder/file names, frame keys, the
top-down→bottom-up Y-flip (`textureHeight - y - h`), computed textureHeight vs
real PNG canvas, bottom-up pivots, and no west double-mirror all verified
correct. **Fixed one real bug:** mood sheets at 4x are 2048×3072, past Unity's
default 2048 `maxTextureSize`, which silently downscaled the texture while atlas
rects stayed full-size → broken mood sprites by default. `ConfigureBaseTexture`
now sets `maxTextureSize = 8192`. Still worth an in-editor smoke test (single-
sprite prop/floor pivots; a real 4x import) since slicing can't be unit-tested
headlessly; the Y-flip math and frame-name parsers also have no automated test
yet (cheap future win: make them `internal` + EditMode tests).

Editor script in The-Water-Cooler that ingests the export zip:
- Slices sheets using the atlas JSONs (frames, pivots).
- Applies projection metadata: plan props → center pivot, floor sorting
  layer, rotation allowed; elevation → base pivot, y-sorted.
- Builds RuleTiles (or a mask→sprite lookup) from wall tileset atlases.
- Generates prefabs per character/prop.
- **Why before the port:** pre-baked sprites + this importer may be all the
  game needs for a long time. The port is only urgent if runtime NPC
  generation is needed.

### 2.2 Runtime rendering decision (chosen hybrid)
The C# port should not draw vector shapes in Unity. Runtime generation should
assemble imported sprites from data:
- **Baked sheets for maps, props, walls, and floors** — the tool exports final
  sprite sheets/atlases plus JSON metadata. Unity imports them once, then the
  map generator places sprites via layout JSON, tile masks, prop ids, pivots,
  sorting hints, and projection metadata.
- **Layer atlases for generated coworkers** — the tool exports body/head/hair/
  outfit/accessory/mood layers as separate neutral or token-mask textures.
  Unity generates NPC recipes, then stacks/tints those layers by facing, mood,
  anchor, z-order, and palette.

Rejected or limited alternatives:
- **Unity VectorGraphics package** — parse the part SVGs directly, rasterize
  to textures at runtime. Closest to a straight vector port, but more runtime
  complexity than this project needs.
- **Shapes library** (already in the project) — render parts as immediate-mode
  vector draws; useful for editor/debug overlays and procedural primitives, but
  not a drop-in compositor for these assets because the current parts are SVG
  path data and Shapes has no SVG importer. Choosing it as the primary runtime
  renderer would mean re-authoring/constraining art to Shapes primitives and
  issuing carefully ordered draw calls every frame.
Keep Shapes available for map gizmos, placement previews, selection rings,
route/debug lines, room bounds, or intentionally primitive procedural graphics.

Spike proof:
- **Tool-side half — DONE (2026-06-13).** `characterLayerSheetPng` +
  `characterLayerManifest` (exporter.ts), backed by `characterLayers` in
  compositor.ts, export a character as outline-free, re-tintable part layers:
  one row per (part × colour-source) + mood rows, one column per facing. Token
  colours render as WHITE MASKS the engine multiplies by the recipe colour
  (preserves AA); literal detail renders untinted; mood layers swap by the
  active mood. Manifest carries z-order, tint token, mood, and Y-flip-ready
  frame rects (reuses the 2.1 slicing path). Exposed via "Layer atlas PNG" /
  "Layer manifest JSON" buttons on the character panel.
  **Validated:** a Unity-style consumer (slice frames → multiply masks by
  palette → stack by z → swap mood) reconstructs every cast member across all
  4 moods/facings at mean diff **0.02/255** vs `composeCharacter` (outline-free)
  — pixel-faithful. Two palettes + moods from one atlas yield distinct
  coworkers. **Outline is a baked silhouette layer** (layer key `outline`,
  z -1, untinted) — the engine draws it first, no shader needed; rebuild WITH
  it matches `composeCharacter` (outline on) at mean **0.008/255**. The layer
  atlas now also ships inside the export-all zip under
  `character-layers/<slug>/` (`layers@Nx.png` + `manifest@Nx.json` + recipe),
  so the existing zip-import flow can reach it.
- **Unity-side half — CODE WRITTEN (2026-06-13), UNVERIFIED in-editor.** In
  The-Water-Cooler:
  - `Runtime/Phase2/SpriteToolkitLayerAtlas.cs` — `SpriteToolkitLayerAtlas` SO
    (layers with z/tint/mood + per-facing sprites, default palette) and
    `SpriteToolkitNpcComposer` (SelectLayers by mood + (z,order); Compose
    stacks SpriteRenderers, `color = palette[tint]` — stock sprite shader does
    the multiply, no shader; SortingGroup on the parent; outline layer drawn
    first).
  - `Editor/Phase2/SpriteToolkitZipImporter.cs` — `ImportCharacterLayers` reads
    `character-layers/*/manifest@Nx.json`, slices `layers@Nx.png` via the
    existing AtlasJson Y-flip path, builds the SO; prefers 2x (4x layer sheets
    hit the texture-size ceiling). Wired into the catalog.
  - `Tests/EditMode/SpriteToolkitNpcComposerTests.cs` — layer selection/order/
    mood-filter + tint resolution (pure logic, runs headless).
  - **Verify on the working machine:** (1) EditMode tests pass; (2) re-export
    the zip, run the importer, confirm a `SpriteToolkitLayerAtlas` asset per
    character with sliced layer sprites; (3) `Compose` two coworkers (different
    palette + mood + facing) — confirm correct tint, no seams, outline reads;
    (4) check `SortingGroup` resolves (else drop that line — composer works
    without it); (5) confirm single-sprite pivots and the 2x slice look right.
    Then generate one small office from layout JSON. New .cs files get .meta
    files auto-generated on first Unity import.

### 2.3 C# compositor port
Port only the data model + sprite-layer assembly needed for generated
coworkers: recipes, palette token resolution, anchors, z-order, proportions,
facings, and mood overlays. This is an `NpcSpriteComposer`, not a vector
renderer. Maps do not use this path; they assemble from the runtime layout
generator (2.4) plus imported tile/prop sprite lookups. The outline pass should
stay baked unless the layer atlas spike proves a shader outline is necessary.
Target API: `NpcSpriteSet Compose(CharacterRecipe recipe, StyleSheet style)`.

### 2.4 C# layout generator port (runtime offices)
**Decision (locked):** offices are generated procedurally **at runtime in
Unity**, not pre-authored. So `src/core/layout.ts` gets a real C# port — Unity
produces a fresh, seeded office each playthrough rather than loading exported
layout JSON. (The tool's layout JSON export stays as a debug/authoring and
golden-test artifact, not the shipping path.)

Port to a deterministic `OfficeLayoutGenerator`:
- **Room templates** — the shared-edge `RoomSpec` rects per template (adjacent
  rooms must overlap one tile on boundaries — porting note: this is what keeps
  walls single, not double), plus the room archetype set (reception, manager,
  break, conference, cubicle farm, hallway, waiting-nook, focus/copy/records
  rooms, storage closet).
- **Seeded RNG** — `mulberry32` threaded through every random choice; the
  determinism contract is load-bearing: same `{templateId, seed}` ⇒ identical
  office, so the game can store/replay a building from two numbers. Match the
  JS RNG bit-for-bit OR accept that C# diverges and treat seeds as engine-local.
- **Wall drawing** — perimeter + shared room walls, office-wall shell
  re-asserted last (interior glass never on the exterior), single-tile doorways
  cleared with one door prop each (no widening), badge-reader pairing.
- **Cubicle comb** — partition spines never parallel-adjacent to a room wall
  (fuses into a lattice); pods skip door-gap columns; seats returned so
  coworkers spawn seated.
- **Furnishing rules** — per-room prop placement scaled to room size (break
  room/​reception always get a centre cluster so big rooms don't read empty),
  non-destructive spawn (never deletes furniture; chairs are the only sit-able
  prop).
- **Output** — an in-memory scene (floor-id grid, wall-id grid, prop/character
  placements with rotation/facing/mood) that the Unity map assembler turns into
  instantiated sprites via the imported tile/prop atlases + the 2.3 NPC composer
  for spawned coworkers.

The renderer that consumes this output must also replicate two tool-side
render-time rules (documented in scene.ts): **per-quadrant floor resolution**
(floors stay inside wall bounds; borrow the neighbour/diagonal room's floor at
walls and thresholds) and **walls extending an arm into door tiles** (close the
gap beside a door without latticing cubicle openings). Depends on 2.1 (import)
and 2.3 (NPC composer).

### 2.5 Headless export CLI
`npm run export -- project.json out/` — regenerate every asset without the
browser (resvg-js or playwright for SVG→PNG). Lets the game's build pipeline
treat art as a compiled artifact of `project.json`, which is the whole point
of art-as-data.

## Phase 3 — Content depth & hardening

### 3.1 Remaining object taxonomy — DONE
Implemented with: wall-slot door/open-door/window/nameplate/HVAC templates,
door open/closed state parameter, badge-reader pairing in generated doorways,
desk clutter, couch, rug, vending machine, default prop instances, starter-scene
coverage, generated-office placement rules, and `placement` metadata in prop
atlases plus layout JSON.
- **Door** — special wall-slot tile (fits into a wall run, open/closed
  states); pairs with the badge reader.
- Window (wall-slot, like door), nameplate, HVAC vent, desk clutter
  (papers, phone), couch + rug (plan), vending machine (elevation).

### 3.2 Part library growth — DONE (outfits reworked 2026-06-13)
Implemented with: three additional head shapes (long, angular, soft square),
five hair variants (side part, pixie, ponytail, long straight, coils), outfits,
and five accessories/carried overlays (watch, earbuds, clipboard, coffee run,
stack of papers) exposed through the existing character selectors and random
coworker generator.

Review found the first-pass outfits (hoodie, suit jacket, dress) broke the
established outfit convention — they drew whole-garment shapes in
`$outfitSecondary` instead of minimal collar/detail overlays on the
`$outfitPrimary` body capsule, and the dress flared a sharp un-outlined skirt
*outside* the body silhouette. All three were re-authored to the convention
(detail accents inside the silhouette, body capsule = the garment), and two
more were added for variety (turtleneck, sweater vest). Heads, hair, and
accessories were spot-checked and are stylistically consistent — no rework.
Outfit slot now has 10 options.
More heads, hair, outfits (hoodie, suit jacket, dress), accessories (watch,
earbuds, clipboard). Carried-item overlays for characters (coffee run, stack
of papers) — same slot system, anchored at the hands.

### 3.3 Compositor snapshot tests
Golden-file tests (vitest): compose the cast + every part + all 16 wall masks
against committed SVG snapshots. The north-facing hair bug was exactly the
class of regression this catches — geometry helpers silently misbehaving for
inputs nobody eyeballed.

### 3.4 Atlas packing & texture hygiene
Single packed atlas option (everything in one texture with a JSON map),
1–2px bleed gutters for mipmapping/filtering, POT-sized outputs. Matters
once the game ships dozens of sheets.

### 3.5 Project schema versioning
The save format is patched ad-hoc (`??=` defaults). Before the game starts
consuming project.json, add a `version` bump + explicit migration steps so
old saves and the game's expectations can't drift apart.

---

## Explicitly out of scope (on purpose)

- **Frame animation** — the RimWorld slide-and-bob convention is a core scope
  decision, not a missing feature. Re-litigate only if playtests demand it.
- **Game logic** (pathfinding, sim hooks, AI) — the layout generator (both the
  TS original and the 2.4 C# port) only produces geometry and placements; the
  game owns all behavior on top of that data.
- **Isometric projection** — would invalidate the part library; the top-down
  hybrid is settled.
