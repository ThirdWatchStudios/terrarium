# Export Contract — Terrarium → The Water Cooler

What this tool **provides** to the Unity sim, and what the sim is expected to **compute** from it.

This is the tool-side companion to the canonical design specs
(`game-design-docs/the-water-cooler/docs/design/character_model.md` and
`scenario_model.md`, which the export `meta.schema` fields point at). When the two
disagree, the design spec wins for *intent*; this doc wins for *the actual bytes
we currently emit*.

Status: **living sketch.** The payload shapes here are real (taken from the
exporters). The "Sim-side formulas" section is a design sketch — it exists to
pin down what data we must capture here so the sim has what it needs.

## 1. Ownership boundary

| Concern | Owner | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Visual recipe, sprite atlas, layout art | **Tool** | Authored + rendered + exported. |
| Personality spine (OCEAN, game axes) | **Tool** | Authored. |
| Derived personality fields (temper, grudge-holding, reaction tendencies, volatility) | **Tool** | Computed here — see §4. The sim consumes the numbers; it does not re-derive them. |
| Needs, preferences, skills, baseline relationships, routine, formative events | **Tool** | Authored / exported. Mostly inert metadata here (not computed on). |
| Drive catalog (structured, reusable; `amplifiesNeeds`) | **Tool** | Project-level catalog (§3.5); personas reference by id. The need coupling is tool-authored data the sim acts on. |
| Trait catalog (structured, reusable; `biasesReactions`) | **Tool** | Project-level catalog (§3.6); persona `traitTags` are ids into it. Reaction nudges are tool-authored data the sim applies on top of the spine-derived tendencies. |
| Scenario situation (truth, information, experiment, objective, seeds) | **Tool** | Authored + exported. |
| **Behavior** — how any of the above turns into decisions, need depletion, relationship drift, belief spread, KPI scoring | **Sim** | Not implemented in this repo. See §5. |
| The meaning of a free-text id (a `drive`, a `trait_tag`, a `locationId`, a routine `activity`) | **Sim** | The tool deliberately does not enforce these vocabularies — it ships strings; the sim decides what they do (and should log/fallback on ids it doesn't implement). |

**The id contract (one id space):** `agentId` == recipe `id` == persona key == scenario cast `agentId` == sim `AgentId`. Everything links by this id. `spriteBinding.characterConfigId == agentId` by convention.

Coordinate convention: scene grids are row-major `[y][x]`; anchors/spawns carry explicit `{x, y}` cells.

## 2. Export bundle

| File | Built by | Per | Contents |
|---|---|---|---|
| `<name>-recipe.json` | recipe (verbatim) | character | Visual recipe (§3.1). |
| `<name>-atlas@Nx.json` + sheet/layer PNGs | `characterAtlas` / `characterLayerManifest` | character | Sprite frames + anchors for the renderer. |
| `<agentId>-profile.json` | `serializeProfile` | character | Persona (§3.2). `meta.schema = character_model.md`. |
| `scenario.json` | `serializeScenario` | scenario | Scenario verbatim + `meta.schema = scenario_model.md` (§3.3). |
| `employees.json` | `buildScenarioPackage` | scenario | Flattened roster (id, dept, role, tags, spawn). |
| `relationships.json` | `buildScenarioPackage` | scenario | Resolved source→target edges (persona baseline + scenario overrides). |
| `beliefs.json` | `buildScenarioPackage` | scenario | Per-agent starting beliefs (from cast `beliefSeeds`). |
| `knowledge.json` | `buildScenarioPackage` | scenario | Truth facts, information items, per-agent `knows`. |
| `drives.json` | `project.drives` (verbatim) | project | Reusable drive catalog personas reference by id (§3.5). Also embedded in each scenario package. |
| `traits.json` | `project.traits` (verbatim) | project | Reusable trait catalog persona `traitTags` reference by id (§3.6). Also embedded in each scenario package. |
| `office-layout.json` | `sceneToLayoutJson` | scene | Rooms, floors, walls, props, spawns, anchors, interaction anchors (§3.4). |
| `interaction-anchors.json` | `computeInteractionAnchors` | scene | Interaction points derived from placed props. |

`buildScenarioPackage` is the assembled bundle — it runs `resolveScenarioRun` (persona baseline + scenario seeds/overrides) and emits the scenario-scoped files above.

## 3. Payload shapes

All numeric ranges are `0–100` unless noted. `affinity` is bipolar `-100..100`; preference `valence` is `-100..100`.

> Note: beliefs/knowledge are **not** in the persona — they're scenario state (cast `beliefSeeds` / `knowledgeSeeds`). The persona owns the durable character; the scenario owns the situation.

### 3.3 `scenario.json` — `serializeScenario` (the `Scenario` verbatim + `meta`)
Top level: `scenarioId, title, summary, officeSeed?, cast[], locations[], truthFacts[], informationItems[], interventionTypes[], variants[], defaultVariantId, objective`.
- `cast[]`: `{ agentId, spawnLocationId, prototypeRole, relationshipOverrides[], beliefSeeds[], knowledgeSeeds[] }`
- `locations[]`: `{ locationId, displayName, tags[], accessState, fallbackLocationId, bindTo:{ anchorId, roomId } }`
- `truthFacts[]`: `{ truthId, topic, statement, subjectAgentIds[], objectiveValue:bool, sourceAgentId }`
- `informationItems[]`: `{ informationId, topic, claim, originType, truthId, truthAlignment, sourceAgentId, initialHolderAgentIds[] }`
- `variants[]`: `{ variantId, selections: { <interventionType>: <value> } }`
- `objective`: `{ objectiveId, label, category, desiredPressure, intendedObservableBehavior, kpi, expectedEvidence[] }`

### 3.4 `office-layout.json` — `sceneToLayoutJson`
`{ version, source, generated, cols, rows, rooms[], roomGrid[][], floors[][], walls{grid[][],cells[]}, props[], characterSpawns[], anchors[], interactionAnchors[] }`
- `anchors[]`: `{ anchorId, roomId, x, y, kind: "room"|"desk" }` — what scenario `locations[].bindTo` resolves to.
- `interactionAnchors[]`: `{ id, interactionType, roomId, x, y }` — derived from interaction props (water cooler, printer, …).

### 3.5 `drives.json` (reusable drive catalog) — project-level
The shared set of motivations personas reference by id. `profile.drives.primary/secondary` and `objectives[].sourceDrive` are ids into this catalog.
```jsonc
[
  { "id": "advance_career", "label": "Advance career",
    "description": "Climb the ladder; take on higher-profile work.",
    "category": "status|security|power|social|growth",
    "amplifiesNeeds": ["recognition", "competence"] }   // subset of the 6 need ids
]
```
A persona drive id not present here is a valid one-off — the sim should fallback + log (§7). Shipped both at the bundle root and inside each `scenarios/<id>/` package so a scenario bundle is self-contained.

### 3.6 `traits.json` (reusable trait catalog) — project-level
The shared set of personality tags persona `traitTags` reference by id. `biasesReactions` are signed nudges to the reaction propensities on a coarse **−2..+2** scale (only non-zero categories stored); the sim scales to its own units and applies them on top of the spine-derived reaction tendencies (§4).
```jsonc
[
  { "id": "hot_headed", "label": "Hot-headed",
    "description": "Quick to anger.",
    "category": "work_ethic|social|politics|temperament|integrity|openness|competence|status",
    "biasesReactions": { "confront": 2, "escalate": 2 } }   // subset of the 7 reaction categories
]
```
As with drives, a persona may carry a trait id absent from the catalog — fallback + log (§7). Shipped at the bundle root and in each scenario package.

## 4. Formulas computed **in the tool** (authoritative)

These run in `applyDerived` before export ([src/core/profile.ts](src/core/profile.ts)). Authored overrides win; otherwise the value is derived. Helpers: `avg(...)` = arithmetic mean; `clampUnit` = clamp to `0–100`. All inputs are `0–100`.

```
temper          = clamp( 0.6·neuroticism + 0.4·(100 − agreeableness) )
grudgeHolding   = clamp( 0.6·(100 − agreeableness) + 0.4·neuroticism )

confront        = avg( extraversion, 100 − agreeableness, temper )
gossip          = avg( 100 − discretion, extraversion )
withdraw        = avg( neuroticism, 100 − extraversion )
verify          = avg( conscientiousness, integrity )
reassure        = avg( agreeableness, extraversion )
escalate        = avg( ambition, conscientiousness )
ignore          = avg( 100 − extraversion, 100 − neuroticism )

volatility      = avg( neuroticism, temper )
```

Inputs are **only** OCEAN + the four primary game axes (ambition, integrity, loyalty, discretion). **Drives, trait tags, needs, preferences, skills, and objectives feed nothing here** — they are authored → exported, and given meaning by the sim.

---

## 5. Formulas the **sim** owns (design sketch — NOT implemented here)

This section is the point of the doc: deciding these tells us what to capture in the tool. Treat everything below as **proposed/TBD** until the Unity side commits.

### 5.1 Drives → behavior
Drives are now a **structured, reusable catalog** (`drives.json`, §3.5) that personas reference by id. Each drive carries `amplifiesNeeds` — the tool-authored coupling the sim acts on. Resolution the sim owns:
- Look up the persona's `drives.primary`/`secondary` ids in the catalog. `primary` should weigh heavier than `secondary` (e.g. 2:1).
- A drive raises motivation pressure on its `amplifiesNeeds` (combine with §5.2 need depletion).
- `objectives[]` gate/scope drives to a concern: `{ sourceDrive, targetOrConcern, expectedBehaviorTendency, status }` — only `status:"active"` objectives apply; `expectedBehaviorTendency` is the predicted action when the concern is salient.
- **Unknown id discipline:** a persona may reference a drive id absent from the catalog (a one-off). The sim should fallback + log, never hard-fail.

**Still sim-owned:** action *selection* from drive pressure, and any per-drive reaction bias beyond the need coupling (we deliberately did not author reaction weights per drive — that would overlap the spine-derived reaction tendencies in §4).

### 5.2 Needs depletion / pressure
`needs[id] = { baseline, sensitivity }`. Sketch: satisfaction starts at `baseline`, depletes over time scaled by `sensitivity`, and the most-deprived need (optionally weighted by active drives, §5.1) sets current motivation. The tool already surfaces "top needs" by `sensitivity` for preview only.

### 5.3 Reaction selection
On an event, the sim picks among the 7 `reactionTendencies` (already numeric, §4) — likely a weighted/softmax draw, modulated by `temperament.volatility`, current mood, and the triggering relationship. **Trait biases (§3.6) apply here:** for each trait the persona carries, add its `biasesReactions` nudges (scaled) to the corresponding tendencies before selecting. Tool provides the base tendencies + trait nudges; sim provides the combine + selection rule.

### 5.4 Relationship dynamics
`relationships[]` (resolved baseline + overrides) are the **starting** edges. The sim evolves them over the run (trust/suspicion/affinity/influence/respect/familiarity drift from interactions, gated by `grudgeHolding` for how long slights persist). Tool ships start state + `grudgeHolding`; sim owns the drift model.

### 5.5 Belief & information propagation
`beliefs.json` (per-agent stance+confidence) and `knowledge.json` (truths, information items, who-knows-what) are start state. The sim owns spread: who shares with whom (gated by `gossip` tendency, `discretion`, affinity, `accessState` of shared locations), and how `truthAlignment`/`originType` shift a receiver's `confidence`/`stance`.

### 5.6 Objective / KPI scoring
`objective.kpi` + `expectedEvidence[]` + the active `variant`'s `selections` define what a run is measured against. The sim owns the measurement; the tool owns the definition. KPI strings are free-text — same registry/fallback discipline as drives.

---

## 6. Open data-capture questions

Things the sim will likely need that the tool does **not** capture yet — decide before building the sim side:

1. ~~Drive semantics location~~ — **Resolved:** drives are a tool-authored structured catalog with a `amplifiesNeeds` coupling (§3.5/§5.1). Open sub-question: does the sim also want per-drive reaction biases, or is need coupling enough?
2. **KPI/objective evaluators** — is `kpi` a known enum the sim implements, or fully free-form? Do we want a `kpi` vocabulary + "unknown KPI" warning in the tool?
3. **Location/activity vocabularies** — `routine[].locationId/activity` and scenario `locationId`s are free-text; the sim owns the real set. Do we want the tool to validate routine `locationId`s against the scenario's declared locations?
4. **Time model** — routine uses `"HH:MM"` strings; the sim needs a day-length / tick mapping (tool doesn't model time).
5. **Need ↔ drive coupling** — if the sim wants explicit "this drive amplifies these needs," that mapping currently lives nowhere; decide whether it's tool data or sim code.

---

## 7. Compatibility rules

- **Adding** a suggestion to a free-text vocabulary (drive, trait tag, KPI, location) is **non-breaking** — it only affects authoring autocomplete, never validation or export shape.
- **Renaming/removing a field** in §3 **is** breaking — bump the relevant `meta.schema` and update the sim loader.
- The sim should **fallback + log**, never hard-fail, on an unrecognized free-text id (drive, KPI, activity). That tolerance is what lets the tool ship a richer vocabulary without lockstep sim releases.
