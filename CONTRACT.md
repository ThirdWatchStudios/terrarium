# Export Contract — Terrarium → The Water Cooler

What this tool **provides** to the Unity sim, and what the sim is expected to **compute** from it.

This is the tool-side companion to the canonical design specs
(`game-design-docs/the-water-cooler/docs/design/character_model.md` and
`scenario_model.md`, which the export `meta.schema` fields point at). When the two
disagree, the design spec wins for *intent*; this doc wins for *the actual bytes
we currently emit*.

Status: **living sketch.** The payload shapes here are real (taken from the
exporters). The "Sim-side formulas" section is a design sketch — it exists to
pin down what data we must capture here so the sim has what it needs.

---

## 1. Ownership boundary

| Concern | Owner | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Visual recipe, sprite atlas, layout art | **Tool** | Authored + rendered + exported. |
| Status & interaction visuals (moods, activity badges, conversation style) | **Tool** | Tool owns the *vocabulary + art*; the sim *selects + places* at runtime — moods by behavioral state, activity badges by routine `activity`, the conversation connector by its own agent pairing (§3.9). None are baked into recipes. |
| Personality spine (OCEAN, game axes) | **Tool** | Authored. |
| Derived personality fields (temper, grudge-holding, reaction tendencies, volatility) | **Tool** | Computed here — see §4. The sim consumes the numbers; it does not re-derive them. |
| **Presence** — physical-expression dispositions (how a body occupies space: gait, restlessness, personal space, expressiveness, commitment, latency, attentiveness) | **Tool** | Derived from the spine (§4), sticky once authored; resolved to plain numbers on export (§3.2). The tool authors the **adverbs** (how a body moves), never the **verbs** (what it does / when). The sim owns the curves/timing, the per-emotion modulation, and the **pairwise resolution** when two bodies meet — see §5.8. |
| Needs, preferences, skills, baseline relationships, routine, formative events | **Tool** | Authored / exported. Mostly inert metadata here (not computed on). |
| Drive catalog (structured, reusable; `amplifiesNeeds`) | **Tool** | Project-level catalog (§3.5); personas reference by id. The need coupling is tool-authored data the sim acts on. |
| Trait catalog (structured, reusable; `biasesReactions`) | **Tool** | Project-level catalog (§3.6); persona `traitTags` are ids into it. Reaction nudges are tool-authored data the sim applies on top of the spine-derived tendencies. |
| Relationship-type catalog (structured, reusable; `biasesReactions` + `thirdParty`) | **Tool** | Project-level catalog (§3.7); relationship edges' `relationshipType` are ids into it. Carries reaction bias toward the target *and* the third-party (jealousy/protectiveness) coupling — tool-authored data the sim applies at interaction time. |
| Behavior **catalog** (structured, reusable; observable actions + constraints/couplings) | **Tool** | Project-level catalog (§3.14). Authors *what behaviors exist* (Steal Lunch, Spread Rumor, …) plus their context/affordance requirements, pressure pulls, trait modifiers (trait ids, §3.6), relationship requirements (bond ids, §3.7), and expected outcomes. The catalog is tool-authored data; *which behavior happens now* is sim-owned (the row below). |
| Scenario situation (truth, information, experiment, objective, seeds) | **Tool** | Authored + exported. |
| Scenario **templates** (role slots + preconditions + emotional payload) | **Tool** | Cast-agnostic authoring (§3.8). The tool casts a template → a bound scenario at authoring time and exports the bound `scenario.json`; runtime casting is a future sim concern (§5.7). |
| **Behavior** — how any of the above turns into decisions, need depletion, relationship drift, belief spread, KPI scoring | **Sim** | Not implemented in this repo. See §5. |
| The meaning of a free-text id (a `drive`, a `trait_tag`, a `locationId`, a routine `activity`) | **Sim** | The tool deliberately does not enforce these vocabularies — it ships strings; the sim decides what they do (and should log/fallback on ids it doesn't implement). |

**The id contract (one id space):** `agentId` == recipe `id` == persona key == scenario cast `agentId` == sim `AgentId`. Everything links by this id. `spriteBinding.characterConfigId == agentId` by convention.

Coordinate convention: scene grids are row-major `[y][x]`; anchors/spawns carry explicit `{x, y}` cells.

## 2. Export bundle

| File | Built by | Per | Contents |
|---|---|---|---|
| `<name>-recipe.json` | recipe (verbatim) | character | Visual recipe (§3.1). |
| `<name>-atlas@Nx.json` + sheet/layer PNGs | `characterAtlas` / `characterLayerManifest` | character | Sprite frames + anchors for the renderer. |
| `moods@Nx.png` + `moods-atlas@Nx.json` | `moodAtlas` | character | 6 moods × 4 facings; per-character **face overlays** only (the overhead emote is no longer baked here — see mood-emotes). Sim selects by behavioral state (§3.9). |
| `<agentId>-profile.json` | `serializeProfile` | character | Persona (§3.2). `meta.schema = character_model.md`. |
| `scenario.json` | `serializeScenario` | scenario | Scenario verbatim + `meta.schema = scenario_model.md` (§3.3). |
| `employees.json` | `buildScenarioPackage` | scenario | Flattened roster (id, dept, role, tags, spawn). |
| `relationships.json` | `buildScenarioPackage` | scenario | Resolved source→target edges (persona baseline + scenario overrides). |
| `beliefs.json` | `buildScenarioPackage` | scenario | Per-agent starting beliefs (from cast `beliefSeeds`). |
| `knowledge.json` | `buildScenarioPackage` | scenario | Truth facts, information items, per-agent `knows`. |
| `drives.json` | `project.drives` (verbatim) | project | Reusable drive catalog personas reference by id (§3.5). Also embedded in each scenario package. |
| `traits.json` | `project.traits` (verbatim) | project | Reusable trait catalog persona `traitTags` reference by id (§3.6). Also embedded in each scenario package. |
| `relationshipTypes.json` | `project.relationshipTypes` (verbatim) | project | Reusable relationship-type catalog edges' `relationshipType` reference by id (§3.7). Also embedded in each scenario package. |
| `departments.json` | `project.departments` (verbatim) | project | Reusable department catalog — the single org model referenced by stable id (§3.10). Also embedded in each scenario package. |
| `behaviors.json` | `project.behaviors` (verbatim) | project | Reusable workplace-behavior catalog — observable actions the sim selects for agents under pressure (§3.14). Also embedded in each scenario package. |
| `org-structure.json` | `buildOrgStructure` | project | Org chart: departments + members with a visible-structure / fogged-contents split (§3.11). Also embedded in each scenario package. |
| `company.json` | `serializeCompany(project.company)` | project | The **company root** — the new-game seed the rest of the bundle cascaded from (§3.12). The default project ships `MERIDIAN_DYNAMICS`, so a plain export is a company package; emitted whenever `project.company` is set, absent only for a company-stripped (sprite-only) project. |
| `scenario-template.json` | `serializeScenarioTemplateLibrary` | project | The cast-agnostic **scenario-template library** the sim's runtime caster binds onto the live cast/office (§3.8/§5.7). Emitted when a library is supplied to `exportAll`; absent for a sprite-only export. |
| `mood-emotes@Nx.png` + `mood-emotes-atlas@Nx.json` | `moodEmotesAtlas` | project | One **shared** strip of overhead mood bubbles (character-independent) — the emote half of a mood, split out of the sheet. Sim blits one above an agent keyed off mood (§3.9). |
| `activity-badges@Nx.png` + `activity-badges-atlas@Nx.json` | `activityBadgesAtlas` | project | One **shared** strip of overhead status badges (character-independent). Sim blits one above an agent keyed off the routine `activity` string (§3.9). |
| `conversation-style.json` | `conversationStyleJson` | project | Style for the linked-bubble conversation visual; sim draws it between two paired talking agents (§3.9). |
| `overlay-style.json` | `overlayStyleJson` | project | **Floor-overlay look spec** (Epic 36) — the per-channel form/weight/dash/motion **plus the static-richness grammar** (`glow` bloom, directional `flow`, per-agent `endpoints`, emotion-keyed `jitter`) and a cross-channel `focus` model the **Shapes** floor layer reads to draw relationship arcs, pressure halos, info packets, and belief tints from sim state. Discipline preserved: state lines pop via static richness (glow/gradient/endpoints), animation stays reserved for events (`rules.motionEncodesEvents`). Tool owns the look; Shapes owns the drawing. Colors reference theme `--wc-*` (§3.13). |
| `characters/<id>/poses@Nx.png` + `poses-atlas@Nx.json` | `poseSheetPng` / `posesAtlas` | character | **Pose sheet** — the 8 Social Theater held states × 4 facings as full posed frames, keyed `<pose>_<facing>` (§3.16). Ships the `shoulderLeft`/`shoulderRight`/`hip` rig anchors (normalized). A pose is a sim-selected state like a mood — never in the recipe. |
| `pose-catalog.json` | `poseCatalogJson` | project | **Pose vocabulary** — ids + reads-as + presence couplings + transform hints; the beat-schedule contract's tool half (§3.16). No sequencing: beats/dwell/blocking are the sim Director's. |
| `characters/<id>/unit@Nx.png` + `unit-atlas@Nx.json` + `unit-poses@Nx.png` + `unit-poses-atlas@Nx.json` | `unitSheetDesc` / `unitAtlas` / `unitPoseSheetDesc` / `unitPosesAtlas` | character | **Operational-unit sheets** — IRIS's own drawing (§3.17): flat coding-hue pictogram, featureless head disc, no face/hair. Same canvas/anchors/pose rig, so conduct passes through — the unit pose sheet carries all 8 held states × 4 facings. |
| `characters/<id>/portrait@Nx.png` | `composePortrait` | character | **Corporate-identity bust** — the badge photo (§3.17): head-and-shoulders crop, full warm palette, studio paper. The UI frames it (`portrait-frame` icon). |
| `symbol-registry.json` | `symbolRegistryJson` | project | The **symbol registry** — every symbol id in the bundle (floor badges/glyphs/puffs, overlay channels, chrome icons, reactions, cursors) resolved to its **register** (`truth` / `human` / `iris`), `kind` (`signal` / `chrome`), IRIS `provenance` (`measured` / `inferred` / `asserted`), and `mirrors` cross-links between truth↔IRIS siblings (§3.15). Derived from the code-owned vocabularies; the design law is `docs/register-constitution.md`. |
| `theme.uss` + `theme.json` | `themeUss` / `themeJson` | project | The **shared UI palette** as UI Toolkit `:root` custom properties (`--wc-*`) and a framework-neutral map. The single color source the framing UI AND the Shapes floor layer resolve so chrome and world agree without sharing a pipeline (§3.13). `--wc-line` carries the project's actual `style.outline.color`. |
| `icons/<id>.svg` + `icons/<id>@Nx.png` + `icons/icons-manifest.json` | `composeIcon` / `iconsManifest` | project | **UI icon set** — framing-UI glyphs. Each icon ships a resolution-independent SVG (UI Toolkit `VectorImage`) **and** a PNG ladder (uGUI `Sprite`). `tintable` icons are white masks the framework recolors from `theme.uss`; `literal` icons ship final colors (§3.13). |
| `office-layout.json` | `sceneToLayoutJson` | scene | Rooms, floors, walls, props, spawns, anchors, interaction anchors (§3.4). |
| `interaction-anchors.json` | `computeInteractionAnchors` | scene | Interaction points derived from placed props. |
| `ground/<id>/tile@Nx.png` + `atlas@Nx.json` (+ `layers@Nx.png` + `layers-manifest@Nx.json` + `ground.json`) | `groundAtlas` / `groundLayerManifest` | project | **Outdoor ground surfaces** — the DISTINCT *ground kind* (B1.5 "the build site", decision D2): grass / dirt / asphalt / sidewalk. Same flat-tile machinery as floors, but its own folder + `kind:"ground"` atlas + the −20000 sort band, so the sim's `ImportGround` pulls it in as a separate layer under the interior floor and never treats it as paintable floor (§3.18). |
| `construction-crew/<id>/sheet@Nx.png` + `atlas@Nx.json` + `moods(-atlas)@Nx` + `layers@Nx.png` + `manifest@Nx.json` + `unit-layers@Nx.png` + `unit-manifest@Nx.json` + `recipe.json` + `profile.json` | character-export functions | project | **Construction persona** — an authored crew member (hi-vis vest + hard hat) the sim spawns the build crew from (B1.5, decision D4). A code-owned ingredient in its own folder, decoupled from the editable office cast — NOT one of the four lockstep hero agents, so crew size stays dynamic (§3.18). |

`buildScenarioPackage` is the assembled bundle — it runs `resolveScenarioRun` (persona baseline + scenario seeds/overrides) and emits the scenario-scoped files above.

> Note: beliefs/knowledge are **not** in the persona — they're scenario state (cast `beliefSeeds` / `knowledgeSeeds`). The persona owns the durable character; the scenario owns the situation.

### 3.3 `scenario.json` — `serializeScenario` (the `Scenario` verbatim + `meta`)
`meta`: `{ generator, schema: "scenario_model.md", schemaVersion: 9 }`. Top level: `scenarioId, title, summary, officeSeed?, cast[], locations[], truthFacts[], informationItems[], interventionTypes[], variants[], defaultVariantId, objective`.
- `cast[]`: `{ agentId, spawnLocationId, prototypeRole, relationshipOverrides[], beliefSeeds[], knowledgeSeeds[] }`
- `locations[]`: `{ locationId, displayName, tags[], accessState, fallbackLocationId, bindTo:{ anchorId, roomId } }`
- `truthFacts[]`: `{ truthId, topic, statement, subjectAgentIds[], objectiveValue:bool, sourceAgentId }`
- `informationItems[]`: `{ informationId, topic, claim, originType, truthId, truthAlignment, sourceAgentId, initialHolderAgentIds[] }`
- `variants[]`: `{ variantId, selections: { <interventionType>: <value> } }`
- `objective`: `{ objectiveId, label, category, desiredPressure, intendedObservableBehavior, kpi, expectedEvidence[] }`

### 3.4 `office-layout.json` — `sceneToLayoutJson`
`{ version, source, generated, cols, rows, tenantRect, rooms[], roomGrid[][], floors[][], walls{grid[][],cells[]}, props[], characterSpawns[], anchors[], interactionAnchors[], wings[], connectivity[] }` (**version 4** — v2 added `rooms[].departmentId` + the `wings[]` block (F1.1); v3 added the `connectivity[]` wing-adjacency graph (F1.3); v4 added the optional building-surround `tenantRect`).
- `tenantRect`: `{ x, y, cols, rows } | null` — the **playable** office sub-region when a non-playable **building surround** (the "floor in a tower" border) has been added. `cols`/`rows` then describe the **grown** tenant+ring grid; the ring cells (outside `tenantRect`) carry floors/walls/props but **no `roomGrid`/`wings`/`anchors`**, and never produce `interactionAnchors`. `null` ⇒ no surround, the whole grid is playable, exactly as before (additive — old loaders ignore the field). **The sim must clamp pathfinding and spawns to `tenantRect`** (walkability is floor-based, and ring cells carry a lobby floor — so they're walkable unless clamped), and **frame the camera on `tenantRect`, not the grown grid**. See docs/building-surround-model.md.
- `anchors[]`: `{ anchorId, roomId, x, y, kind: "room"|"desk"|"spare-desk", wingId?, departmentId? }` — what scenario `locations[].bindTo` resolves to. Desks seat each base-cast agent **in its own department's wing** (F1.2; the manager binds to their office, so has no desk anchor); `spare-desk:<wingId>:<n>` anchors expose unassigned seats per wing for the sim's later transfers (E41). `wingId`/`departmentId` tag which wing the anchor sits in (`departmentId: null` for the common/main wing).
- `interactionAnchors[]`: `{ id, interactionType, roomId, x, y }` — derived from interaction props (water cooler, printer, …).
- `wings[]`: `{ id, departmentId, label, roomIds[], bounds:{x,y,cols,rows} }` — rooms grouped into department wings (the physical projection of the org chart; sim reveals wing-by-wing + measures wing distance). Each `rooms[]` entry may carry an optional `departmentId` (the F2.1 catalog id) that `computeWings` groups by; untagged rooms fall into `wing-common`. See **§3.4.1** for the composed procedural office the default now ships.
- `connectivity[]`: `{ wings: [wingIdA, wingIdB], doorways }` — the wing-adjacency graph derived from the door topology (F1.3). Each edge is an undirected wing-id pair (sorted) a doorway physically joins; `doorways` = how many (a connection-strength hint). BFS from the entry wing yields **fog-of-war reveal order** + **wing-to-wing (hop) distance**. A single-office layout has one wing and an empty `connectivity[]`; a composed office is connected — every department wing reaches `wing-common` via its corridor doorway, and **wing-to-wing cross-doors may add further edges** (so the edge count is `≥ department-wing count`, not exactly it).
- **Department-tagged spawn (F3.4):** with a generated population, the office auto-derives a wing per department in the cast and seats each agent at a chair **in its department's wing**. In **dense mode** (the golden default) over-capacity agents *stand* on open floor **in their own wing** rather than being dropped (varied desk styles leave some wings short of chairs); the spare-reserving default still leaves transfer headroom and reports overflow.

#### 3.4.1 Composed procedural office (sim-integration notes)

The default golden export and `export company:<archetype>:<seed>` both ship a **procedural meandering-spine** office, *not* the old 22×14 single-office template. Sim importers/binders must handle its shape:

- **Room ids are suffixed / multiplied — bind by `kind`, not `id`.** Bullpens are `cubicle-farm@<dept>` (one per populated department), and there are up to three corridor rooms: `hallway`, `hallway-east`, `hallway-cross`. Every room still carries its archetype in **`kind`** (`cubicle-farm`, `hallway`, `manager-office`, `break-room`, `conference-room`, `reception`, `focus-room`, `copy-room`). **The sim's location map must resolve by `kind`** (and per-agent `desk:<agentId>` / `interactionType` anchors), since the bare ids `cubicle-farm`/`hallway` no longer uniquely exist. Anchors remain the precise bind: `desk:<agentId>` for workstations, `interactionType` for amenities.
- **Layout = reception entrance + a bending spine.** Reception is the full-height left entrance. With ≥4 rooms the spine **bends**: a left block and a right block sit at *different* corridor heights, joined by a full-height **cross corridor** (`hallway-cross`) — an S/Z hallway, not a straight band. Rooms bud off **both** sides at **varied widths/depths** with **staggered doorways**; small `focus-room`/`copy-room` rooms are sprinkled in. The sim-bound common rooms (`manager-office`, `break-room`, `conference-room`, `hallway`) are always present (in `wing-common`); `management` is the manager office, never a bullpen.
- **`cols`/`rows` are not a fixed formula.** `rows` stays 14; `cols` grows roughly with department count but varies with seeded room widths + sprinkled rooms. Do not assume `8 + N*8`. Invariants still hold: every interior cell belongs to a room (no gaps), room interiors are disjoint, single shared walls (inclusive overlap-by-1, no double walls), single-tile doorways, every room reachable from reception.
- **Per-department theming.** Each `cubicle-farm@<dept>` paints its department's `theme.floor` / `theme.wall` (see §3.10) — the sim needs tile sprites for every floor/wall id the catalog can emit (`floor-wood|terrazzo|rubber-mat|utility-vinyl|quiet-carpet|carpet|carpet-tiles|linoleum`, `wall-office|glass|panel|brick|cubicle`); the building shell stays `wall-office`. **Outdoor ground is a separate kind, not in this floor set** — the four outdoor surfaces (`grass|dirt|asphalt|sidewalk`, shipped as ground ids `ground-grass|ground-dirt|ground-asphalt|ground-sidewalk`) ride the `ground/` folder and the ground layer, never the interior floor grid (§3.18).
- **Per-wing amenities.** Every bullpen carries its own `water_cooler` + `printer` (+ plant) interaction anchors, plus a `desk:<agentId>` anchor per seated agent (incl. the generated `golden-<dept>-N` cast).
- **Cast is dynamic.** The default bundle ships the 4 hero agents **plus a generated supporting population** (`golden-<dept>-N`), each with a recipe + `profile.json` + relationships. Enumerate all `characters/*` folders; do not hardcode the 4. `agentId == recipe id == layer-atlas family` still holds.
- **Parity:** the `tests/golden/office-layout/*.json` fixtures changed substantially; the sim-side C# parity fixtures (S1.5.1) must be re-synced from these.

### 3.5 `drives.json` (reusable drive catalog) — project-level
The shared set of motivations personas reference by id. `profile.drives.primary/secondary` and `objectives[].sourceDrive` are ids into this catalog.
```jsonc
[
  { "id": "advance_career", "label": "Advance career",
    "description": "Climb the ladder; take on higher-profile work.",
    "category": "status|security|power|social|growth",
    "amplifiesNeeds": ["recognition", "competence"] }   // subset of the 6 need ids
]
```
A persona drive id not present here is a valid one-off — the sim should fallback + log (§7). Shipped both at the bundle root and inside each `scenarios/<id>/` package so a scenario bundle is self-contained.

### 3.6 `traits.json` (reusable trait catalog) — project-level
The shared set of personality tags persona `traitTags` reference by id. `biasesReactions` are signed nudges to the reaction propensities on a coarse **−2..+2** scale (only non-zero categories stored); the sim scales to its own units and applies them on top of the spine-derived reaction tendencies (§4).
```jsonc
[
  { "id": "hot_headed", "label": "Hot-headed",
    "description": "Quick to anger.",
    "category": "work_ethic|social|politics|temperament|integrity|openness|competence|status",
    "biasesReactions": { "confront": 2, "escalate": 2 } }   // subset of the 7 reaction categories
]
```
As with drives, a persona may carry a trait id absent from the catalog — fallback + log (§7). Shipped at the bundle root and in each scenario package.

### 3.7 `relationshipTypes.json` (reusable relationship-type catalog) — project-level
The shared set of bond types a relationship edge references by id (`relationships[].relationshipType`). `biasesReactions` are signed **−2..+2** nudges (only non-zero stored) to the holder's reactions *toward the target* — the sim applies them like trait biases (§5.3). `thirdParty` is the optional **triangular (jealousy/protectiveness) coupling**: when the *target* of this relationship engages a third party, the holder reacts — `sensitivity` (0–100) is how strongly, `biasesReactions` is the reaction shape, and `intensifiesTowardDisliked` tells the sim to scale it up when that third party is someone the holder regards negatively (a rival / low affinity). Behavior selection stays in the sim (§5.4); the tool ships the coupling.
```jsonc
[
  { "id": "romance", "label": "Romance", "description": "Romantic partner; devoted — and possessive.",
    "category": "professional|social|romantic|adversarial",
    "secretByDefault": true,                                // seeds the per-edge `secret` flag
    "biasesReactions": { "reassure": 2, "confront": -1 },   // toward the target
    "thirdParty": {                                          // optional jealousy hook
      "sensitivity": 80,
      "biasesReactions": { "confront": 1, "withdraw": 1, "escalate": 1 },
      "intensifiesTowardDisliked": true } }
]
```
As with drives/traits, an edge may carry a type id absent from the catalog — fallback + log (§7). Shipped at the bundle root and in each scenario package.

### 3.8 `scenario-template.json` (cast-agnostic template) — **exported, sim-consumed (F4.1)**
A **role-slotted, cast-agnostic** scenario: the full-game third axis (Cast / Office /
Scenario). It references **roles, not agent ids** — every truth/info/seed/spawn names
a `roleId`, and **casting** rewrites roles → agents to emit a bound `Scenario` (§3.3).
Authored in `src/core/scenarioTemplate.ts`; a single template serialized by
`serializeScenarioTemplate` (`meta.artifact = "scenario-template"`), and the whole
**library** by `serializeScenarioTemplateLibrary` → the exported `scenario-template.json`
(`meta.artifact = "scenario-template-library"`, `{ meta, templates[] }`, same
`meta.schemaVersion` as the package). The tool also still casts to a bound `scenario.json`
and exports that; the template artifact is the **runtime caster's** input (§5.7) — it ships
at the bundle root alongside the bound scenarios. The library is passed into `exportAll`
(the UI supplies `ROLE_TEMPLATES`), so a sprite-only export with no library omits the file.
See `docs/scenario-template-model.md`.
```jsonc
{
  "templateId": "the_office_romance",
  "triggering": "emerge",                          // emerge | provoke
  "emotionalPayload": { "targetEmotions": ["infatuation","jealousy","heartbreak"], "description": "…" },
  "roles": [
    { "roleId": "loverA", "label": "Lover A", "required": true,
      "preconditions": [ /* see the precondition vocabulary below */ ] }
  ],
  "roleSeeds":  [ { "roleId": "loverA", "beliefSeeds": [...], "knowledgeSeeds": ["love_note"],
                    "relationshipOverrides": [ { "toRole": "loverB", "affinity": 90 } ] } ],
  "locations":  [ { "locationId": "loverA_desk", "bindRoomId": "cubicle-farm", "bindDeskOfRole": "loverA", … } ],
  "roleSpawns": [ { "roleId": "loverA", "locationId": "loverA_desk" } ],
  "truthFacts": [ { "truthId": "…", "subjectRoles": ["loverA","loverB"], "sourceRole": "loverA", … } ],
  "informationItems": [ { "informationId": "love_note", "sourceRole": "loverA", "initialHolderRoles": ["loverA","loverB"], … } ],
  "interventionTypes": [...], "variants": [...], "defaultVariantId": "…", "objective": { … }   // as §3.3
}
```

**Precondition vocabulary (the persona ↔ scenario casting contract).** Built only on
the catalogs §3.5–§3.7 already define — no parallel vocabulary. Discriminated by `kind`:
```jsonc
{ "kind": "trait", "trait": "gossip", "mode": "has" }            // trait id (§3.6)
{ "kind": "axis",  "axis": "discretion", "op": "lte", "value": 35 }   // OCEAN + game + derived axis, 0–100
{ "kind": "need",  "need": "recognition", "field": "sensitivity", "op": "gte", "value": 70 }
{ "kind": "drive", "anyOf": ["maintain_social_access"] }         // drive ids (§3.5)
{ "kind": "relationship", "toRole": "loverB", "direction": "mutual", "axis": "affinity", "op": "gte", "value": 30 }
{ "kind": "aggregate", "axis": "familiarity", "reduce": "avg", "direction": "outgoing", "op": "lte", "value": 30 }
{ "kind": "department", "department": "sales", "mode": "in" }     // department catalog id (§3.10); mode in|notIn
{ "kind": "crossDepartment", "toRole": "loverA", "relation": "different" }   // relation same|different
{ "kind": "distance", "toRole": "rivalB", "source": "structural", "op": "gte", "value": 50, "weight": 0.5 }  // source structural|spatial; hard (op+value) and/or soft (weight)
}                                                                // axis ∈ trust|suspicion|affinity|influence|respect|familiarity; type/typeAnyOf = relationshipType id (§3.7)
```
`relationship` constrains a candidate **relative to the agent assigned to `toRole`**
(`direction`: outgoing | incoming | mutual). `aggregate` is the **"to-everyone"**
condition — it reduces (min/max/avg) the axis over the *whole cast* (a missing edge =
`missingAs`, default 0), e.g. an outsider with low familiarity to everybody.
**Proximity is the `familiarity` axis** at authoring time — the persona-level proxy the
sim refines with live spatial state (§5.4/§5.7).

**Department predicates (F4.2 — the cross-wing vocabulary).** `department` is **intrinsic**:
the candidate's `identity.department` (a department catalog id, §3.10/§3.2) must equal
(`mode:"in"`) or differ from (`mode:"notIn"`) the named id; an unassigned candidate
(`department: ""`) is `in` nothing and `notIn` everything. `crossDepartment` is
**relational** like `relationship` — it constrains the candidate's department *against the
agent assigned to `toRole`*: `relation:"different"` is the **core cross-department pairing**
(the two slots must resolve to different departments), `relation:"same"` requires the same.
Both sides must have a **known** department — `crossDepartment` never casts onto an
unassigned (`""`) agent, so a cross-wing template can't silently bind department-less
agents. The ids are the same stable ids the org chart (§3.11) and wings (§3.4) key on.

**Organizational-distance predicate (F4.3 — the cross-wing difficulty/payload term).**
`distance` is **relational** (resolved against `toRole`, symmetric) and reads one of two
signals via `source` (default `"structural"`):
- **`structural`** = hop distance in the **reporting tree** (derived from the cast's
  `manager`/`direct-report` edges, §3.7/§3.11) — always resolvable from the cast alone.
- **`spatial`** = wing-hop distance in the office **wing-connectivity graph** (§3.4) —
  resolvable only when a generated office scene is in play.

Distances are normalized **0–100** (graph hops capped at 6, then scaled). The term takes
two **forms**, either or both: a **hard** threshold (`op`+`value`) gating eligibility, and a
**soft** `weight` (may be negative) adding `weight · distance/100` to the casting fit score so
a template can *prefer* a farther-apart (or closer) pairing. An **unknown** distance — no
graph path, or a `spatial` query with no scene — is **inert**: it never blocks the cast and
contributes 0 to the score (fallback discipline, §7). The resolved distances behind the final
cast surface in the casting report (`report.distances[]`) so the sim/payload can scale on how
far apart the pairing landed.

**Distance-source decision (S4.3.1 — recorded, shared with the sim): BOTH, structural-first.**
The tool's authoring-time caster uses **structural** distance by default because it computes
from the cast alone (no office scene required — the company cascade and previews are
scene-less) and is the more semantically meaningful "organizational distance." **Spatial** is
supported as an opt-in `source` when a scene is present, but real spatial proximity is the
**sim's** strength at runtime (the same division already set for proximity↔`familiarity`,
§5.4/§5.7): the sim receives both signals in the bundle — the reporting tree in
`org-structure.json` (§3.11) and the wing graph in `office-layout.json` (§3.4) — and can refine
either. Both forms (hard threshold + soft cost) are supported so a template author can *gate*
on distance or merely *price* difficulty/payload by it.

**Role presence + family.** A role carries `presence: "present" | "absent"` (default
present). An **absent** ("negative") role is resolved — for distinctness and so the
seed/truth/info can reference its agent id — but kept **out of the emitted cast/spawns**
and reported as *the one to keep out* (the Scapegoat's off-scene culprit, the Power
Vacuum's removed authority). A template also carries an optional `family` (free-text
grouping). Both are tool-side authoring concerns; the emitted bound `scenario.json` is
unaffected (an absent role simply contributes no cast member, only the references it's
named in).

### 3.9 Visual interaction system — moods, activity badges, conversation style

The runtime layer that shows *what an agent is doing where it stopped*. Three
parallel pieces, all following the same split: **the tool ships the vocabulary +
art; the sim selects which to show and where to place it.** None are stored in a
recipe. They stack — an agent can be *working* **and** *suspicious* at once.

**Moods** are split into two halves with different ownership shapes:
- **Face overlay** (`moods-atlas@Nx.json`, per character) — eyebrows/mouth painted
  on the head; depends on the face, so it's per-character. 6 states × 4 facings,
  keyed `"<mood>_<facing>"`; north has no face but its frame is still emitted so
  indexing stays uniform. The sim selects a mood from behavioral state and shows
  that frame.
- **Overhead emote** (`mood-emotes-atlas@Nx.json`, one **shared** project-level
  strip) — the bubble above the head. Character-independent, so it ships once and
  is placed by the sim at `aboveHead` — **structurally identical to an activity
  badge** (`normal` has no emote, so idle crowds stay clean). One frame per emoted
  mood, keyed by mood id.

> **Breaking change (full refactor):** the overhead mood emote used to be baked
> into every `moods@Nx.png` frame; it now lives only in `mood-emotes-atlas`
> (`moods-atlas.meta.emoteBaked: false` flags this). A consumer that composites
> from the layer atlas never had the emote at all (it was only ever in the baked
> sheet) — so splitting it out both *fixes* that gap and unifies overhead emote +
> activity badge into one shared-sprite mechanism. The sim importer must now
> composite the shared mood-emote atlas above the head instead of relying on the
> sheet.

**Activity badges** (`activity-badges-atlas@Nx.json`, one **shared** project-level
strip) — a character-independent overhead emote per activity. The "working" badge
looks identical over anyone, so it ships once, not per character.
```jsonc
{
  "kind": "activity-badges",
  "frameSize": 256, "scale": 2,
  "activities": ["work","talking","meeting","break","lunch","idle","walk","monitoring"],
  "frames": { "work": { "x": 0, "y": 0, "w": 256, "h": 256 }, "...": {} },
  "pivot": { "x": 0.5, "y": 0.5 },               // badge bubble center
  // Per-id MOTION INTENT — how the sim should animate the badge, and where it sits
  // in the salience hierarchy. The tool owns the vocabulary, so it owns the intent;
  // the sim still owns the actual curves/timings (this is a recommendation, not a track).
  "motion": {
    "transient": false,                          // ongoing state, not an event flash
    "byId": {
      "work": { "intro": "fade-in", "loop": "none", "outro": "fade-out", "salienceTier": 1 },
      "...": {}
    }
  },
  "meta": { "shared": true, "facingIndependent": true }
}
```
**Social-state badges** (`social-state-badges-atlas@Nx.json`, one **shared**
project-level strip) — the third overhead sibling: an agent's SHORT-TERM social
state (`anxious` / `slighted` / `confident` / `defensive` / `reassured`), the
interpersonal weather left by recent encounters. Ids mirror the sim's
`ShortTermSocialStateLabel`; same shape as the activity atlas (`states` +
`frames` + `attach` at `aboveHead`, stacks with mood/activity). The bubble hue
encodes **valence** (rose = negative, teal-blue = positive — the same semantic
channels as the emotion-spike puff and the trust line); the glyph says which
state. Unknown ids draw nothing. *Sim consumption is a new seam:* today these
states are inspector-text-only — wiring the badge is game-side work
(docs/icon-expansion-plan.md §3.D).

**Emotion glyphs** (`emotion-glyphs-atlas@Nx.json`, one **shared** project-level
strip) — the harvest vocabulary made visible (14 ambient emotions + 3 acute
spikes: `embarrassment` / `vindication` / `relief`). NOT an overhead bubble: each
cell is the bare mark drawn ink-on-halo, **colorless by design** — it sits inside
the Shapes-drawn acute-spike outline, which supplies the emotion's hue from the
overlay-style channels (style stays tweakable post-build). `byId` carries
`{ tier, group, label }` per emotion (tier = ambient|acute; group = the shared
silhouette family). The same geometry ships as tintable `emotion-<id>` icons in
`icons/` for chrome (inspector / capture UI). `meta.placement: "floor-overlay"` —
the overlay owns placement, intensity (tracks the spike), and decay. Unknown ids
draw nothing. (docs/icon-expansion-plan.md §3.B)

All six shared atlases (`activity-badges`, `mood-emotes`, `prop-status-badges`,
`social-state-badges`, `emotion-glyphs`, `attention-puffs`) carry this `motion` block. `transient: true` marks the
event-flash family (attention puffs); the state families are `false`. `salienceTier`
(higher wins) is the authored importance the sim uses for its salience budget, draw
order, and base scale — for attention puffs the tiers encode the §7 hierarchy with
`attn-harvestable` at the top (and `loop: "shimmer"` + `outro: "hold"`, the player's
call-to-action). **Legibility:** every badge cell is drawn with a light contrast halo
behind the dark ink ring so it reads as a sticker against a busy floor, and the source
art is scaled up; the sim still owns the on-floor screen-space size (a min-size clamp).

Runtime convention: the sim reads each agent's current activity, looks up the
matching frame, and blits it above the agent's head. **Placement:** because the
badge is a *separate* sprite (unlike a mood emote, which is baked into the
character sheet), the sim needs to know where the head is — the character
`atlas@Nx.json` now ships `anchors.aboveHead` (per facing, normalized, same
bottom-left origin as `pivot`); the activity atlas echoes the south value in
`attach`. The activity
string stays **free-text, sim-owned** (§1) — the badged set is the *recommended*
vocabulary, not a closed enum; an `activity` with no frame simply draws no badge
(fallback+log, §7). The blank state (`none`) has no frame by design.

**Conversation style** (`conversation-style.json`, one project-level file) — the
look of a 1:1 conversation. The connector is drawn between two **live** world
positions, so the tool can't author the instance, only the style.
```jsonc
{
  "kind": "conversation-style",
  "style": "linked-bubbles",
  "badge": "talking",                            // activity badge shown on each conversant
  "anchor": "aboveHead",                         // per-agent attach point for badge + link
  "link": { "kind": "dotted-arc", "color": "#46C07A", "width": 2.4, "dash": "0.5 5", "bow": 24 }
}
```
Runtime convention: the sim **owns the pairing** (it already pairs agents for
water-cooler gossip). For each pair it shows `badge` on both agents and draws
`link` between their `anchor` points (the arc bows up `bow` canvas units over the
two badges). Group chats (N>2) generalize the same connector across all members.
The tool provides style + the reused `talking` badge; the sim provides pairing +
placement.

### 3.10 `departments.json` (reusable department catalog) — project-level
The single org model — structured department units the office-scale work references by **stable id** (the way drives/traits/relationship-types are catalogs). Category is free-text with a fallback vocabulary (`leadership|finance|commercial|technical|operations|administrative`). The company cascade (Epic 0 F0.3) fills this catalog; layout groups wings by its ids. Personas/employees carry `department` as free text today; the id-reference rewrite is a future migration (Epic 3 F3.1), so a free-text value maps onto a catalog id by exact-id, case-insensitive label, or slug. An entry also carries **optional `capabilities`** (F2.4) — the surveillance **medium(s)** reaching that department grants the player (IT→email/logs, HR→records, Facilities→badge/camera). Free-text + fallback (suggested vocab `email|im|logs|personnel_records|financial_trails|badge_logs|cameras|crm|exec_comms`), seeded by category and overridable; absent = grants nothing. **The tool authors the tags; the sim owns the clearance/medium model** (access tiers, reach, gating) that consumes them — the access/temporal axis is the clearance ladder's, not the tag's. An entry also carries an **optional `theme`** (`{ floor?, wall?, accent? }`) — the visual identity the procedural office paints onto that department's wing (floor/wall are asset ids; `accent` is a hex colour, currently editor-only). Seeded by category, overridable; absent falls back to room-kind defaults. Shipped at the bundle root and in each scenario package.
```jsonc
[
  { "id": "engineering", "label": "Engineering", "category": "technical",
    "capabilities": ["email","im","logs"], "theme": { "floor": "floor-utility-vinyl", "wall": "wall-glass", "accent": "#1FB6C9" } }
]
```

### 3.11 `org-structure.json` (org chart) — project-level, **derived**
The loadable org chart, derived from §3.10 + the personas (`buildOrgStructure`). The load-bearing shape is a **structure / contents split** for the sim's fog-of-war: `structure` is what the player always sees (which departments exist), `contents` is what the sim fogs until a wing is reached (who is inside, the reporting lines, the heads). The sim can load `structure` alone to draw the chart. Every catalog department appears in both `structure.departments` and `contents.members` (possibly empty). Members resolve by mapping each persona's `department` onto a catalog id; unresolved personas land in `unassigned` (F2.5 validation flags them).

**Reporting lines are DERIVED from the `manager` / `direct-report` relationship edges (§3.7), not authored separately (F2.3 decision)** — one source of truth. `manager` edge = the holder reports to the target; `direct-report` edge = the target reports to the holder. Each `contents.reportingLines[]` is a `{ managerAgentId, reportAgentId }`. The **head** per department is the topmost member (no manager *inside* the department), seniority-tiebroken — so every populated department resolves a head even with no reporting edge yet; an empty department's head is `null`. A report with a conflicting or unresolvable manager is flagged at authoring time (not emitted). Deterministic; not stored in the project (recomputed on export). Shipped at the bundle root and in each scenario package.
```jsonc
{
  "structure": {                                            // visible — safe to load without the roster
    "departments": [ { "id": "operations", "label": "Operations", "category": "operations", "capabilities": ["badge_logs","cameras"] } ]
  },                                                        // capabilities (F2.4) are VISIBLE: the player sees what reaching a dept buys before contents un-fog
  "contents": {                                             // fogged — revealed wing-by-wing
    "members": { "operations": ["janice", "carl", "linda"], "management": ["manager"] },  // agentIds by dept id
    "reportingLines": [ { "managerAgentId": "manager", "reportAgentId": "janice" } ],      // derived from §3.7 edges
    "heads": { "operations": "janice", "management": "manager", "legal": null },           // topmost member per dept
    "unassigned": []                                        // personas whose department resolves to no catalog id
  },
  "meta": { "generator": "sprite-character-creator", "schema": "00-company-root-and-cascade.md",
            "departmentCount": 13, "memberCount": 4, "reportingLineCount": 1 }
}
```

### 3.12 `company.json` (the company root) — project-level, **company package**
The **company root** (Epic 0 F0.8), written at the **bundle root** with the existing payloads as its children (org-structure / personas / relationships / `office-layout.json` / `scenario(-template)` below it). It is the new-game seed: the culture/economy/history that *cascaded down* into the departments, people, and relationships in the same bundle. The **default project ships `MERIDIAN_DYNAMICS`** (the reference declining-incumbent) as `project.company`, so a plain export is already a complete company package the sim can load without running the cascade; a *generated* company (`export company:<archetype>:<seed>`) replaces it with a cascaded org. Climate aggregates resolve to plain numbers (the sim shouldn't re-derive); the editable form (with `Derived` wrappers + `authored` flags) lives in `project.json`. Additive — no existing payload changes shape, and a company-stripped (sprite-only) export simply omits this file, so single-scenario bundles load exactly as before.
```jsonc
{
  "companyId": "acme",
  "identity": { "name": "Acme Co", "industry": "Software", "sizeBand": "small", "headcount": 50, "ownership": "bootstrapped", "reputation": 56 },
  "culture": { "hierarchy": 28, "secrecy": 40, "volatility": 63, "cutthroat": 42, "mercenary": 17, "pace": 86, "fear": 27 },
  "economy": { "financialHealth": 50, "trajectory": "growing", "morale": 55, "runwayMonths": 18 },
  "mission": { "statedMission": "…", "actualPriority": "…", "hypocrisyGap": 40 },
  "history": [ { "id": "lay", "kind": "layoff", "when": "recent", "magnitude": 80, "visibility": "public", "involvedDepartments": ["Engineering"] } ],
  "narrative": { "officialStory": "…", "realStory": "…", "openSecrets": ["…"] },
  "socialClimate": { "orgTrust": 50, "rivalries": [], "powerCenters": [] },
  "climate": { "factionalism": 41, "fear": 39, "volatility": 71 },             // derived → flat numbers (sim doesn't re-derive)
  "meta": { "generator": "sprite-character-creator", "schema": "00-company-root-and-cascade.md" }
}
```

### 3.13 UI assets — `theme.uss` / `theme.json` + `icons/*` (project-level)
The framing UI's share of the bundle (full rationale: [docs/ui-art-plan.md](docs/ui-art-plan.md)).

**Ownership boundary.** The tool owns every UI shape with **no state, no layout, and no text** — icons, glyphs, ornaments — plus the shared color palette. The Unity UI framework (uGUI today, UI Toolkit/USS as the migration target) owns every **container, control, state, and string**: panels, buttons, scrollbars, typography, and all interaction states (`:hover`/`:active`/`:disabled`), 9-slice, and layout. An icon may sit *inside* a button; a button is never a tool asset. Do not request panel/button/text sprites from this tool.

**`theme.json` / `theme.uss`** — one canonical palette ([src/data/uiPalette.ts](src/data/uiPalette.ts)) emitted two ways: USS `:root` custom properties for UI Toolkit and a flat `{ palette: { name: hex } }` map for uGUI / non-USS consumers. Names: `ink`, `on-color`, `line` (= the project's `style.outline.color`), `surface`, `panel`, `accent`, `status-*` (info/positive/warning/danger/neutral), and `emote-*` (the activity + mood bubble hues, so chrome legends match the world). This is the cohesion contract: world sprites and chrome resolve the **same** colors without sharing a pipeline.

**`icons/`** — each `IconDef` emits `icons/<id>.svg` (resolution-independent, design `viewBox="0 0 128 128"` — import as a UI Toolkit `VectorImage`) and a non-pixelated PNG ladder `icons/<id>@{1,2,4}x.png` (uGUI `Sprite`), from one definition, so assets survive the uGUI→UI Toolkit migration unchanged. `icons/icons-manifest.json` indexes them:
```jsonc
{
  "kind": "icons",
  "designCanvas": 128,
  "icons": [
    { "id": "ui-gear", "label": "Settings", "mode": "tintable",
      "svg": "icons/ui-gear.svg", "png": ["icons/ui-gear@1x.png", "icons/ui-gear@2x.png", "icons/ui-gear@4x.png"] }
  ]
}
```
**Tinting.** `mode: "tintable"` icons are **white masks** — recolor with one flat multiply (USS `unity-background-image-tint-color`, uGUI `Image.color`), pulling from `theme.uss` `--wc-*`. Because the multiply is flat, tintable icons are single-color by construction. `mode: "literal"` icons ship final multi-hue colors and are not recolored. Unknown ids draw nothing (free-text-with-fallback, consistent with badges).

The shipped icon set is catalog-grounded: control glyphs + trim (tintable), department-CATEGORY glyphs (`dept-*`, tintable — the six `DEFAULT_DEPARTMENTS` categories), the six canonical needs (`need-*`, tintable), and relationship-CATEGORY glyphs (`rel-*`, literal, colored from `--wc-rel-*`). These cover the coarse groupings; leaf-level coverage tracks the UI epic.

**UI-STATE-ICON set (`state-*`, tintable)** — the **chrome register** of the overhead floor-state vocabulary, for the workstation inspector's SIGNALS strip / Thread / dossier (dual-register rule: the floor speaks in sitcom bubbles, the chrome in clinical line icons — the floor atlases are the wrong art for UI even at @4x). One tight-crop (~8% padding) single-color line icon per floor-state cell, id = `state-<family>-<id>`: `state-activity-{work,walk,break,meeting,talking,idle,disrupted}` (the sim-surfaced routine states), `state-social-<id>` (all 5 `social-state-badges` cells), `state-mood-<id>` (the 5 emoted `mood-emotes` cells; `normal` has no cell), `state-emotion-<id>` (all 17 `emotion-glyphs` cells), and `state-attn-<id>` (all 4 attention categories). Strong floor silhouettes (harvestable gem, conflict shuriken, tremor lines…) carry over re-drawn in line style so recognition survives the register switch. Ids are the contract — the sim resolves them through this icon catalog and should fall back to the floor sprite when a `state-*` id is missing; art may be revised freely. Authored in [src/parts/stateIcons.ts](src/parts/stateIcons.ts); legibility guard: `docs/previews/state-icons-preview.html` (24 px, both themes; regenerate with `npx tsx scripts/stateIconPreview.ts`).

**`cursors/`** — cursors are textures, not vectors, so they export **PNG-only**: `cursors/<id>@{1,2,4}x.png` + `cursors/cursors-manifest.json`. Each manifest entry carries a **normalized `hotspot`** `{x,y}` (0..1, multiply by chosen texture size for the active pixel). Cursors render dark ink under a light halo so the pointer reads on any background. Wire via USS `cursor: url("…") <x> <y>` / uGUI `Cursor.SetCursor`.

**Epic 36 palette + floor channels.** The theme ships the surveillance-workstation palette (`ui_visual_design.md` "Visual Language"): charcoal/slate `--wc-surface`/`--wc-panel`, light `--wc-text`, a single institutional **teal-blue** `--wc-accent`, amber `--wc-status-warning`, red `--wc-status-danger` (used rarely). It also ships the **floor-overlay channel tokens** — `--wc-trust`, `--wc-suspicion`, `--wc-hostility`, `--wc-belief-truth`, `--wc-belief-rumor`, `--wc-pressure`, `--wc-information`, `--wc-change`, `--wc-surveillance` — so the Shapes floor layer (`overlay-style.json`) and the chrome resolve **one** palette. Note `emote-*` (sprite badge hues) are separate and unchanged.

### 3.14 `behaviors.json` (reusable workplace-behavior catalog) — project-level
The shared set of **observable office actions** an agent can take to express inner state — the bridge between drives / needs / pressures / traits / emotional state and what a coworker actually *sees happen*. The tool authors **what behaviors exist** and their constraints/couplings; the sim owns **which behavior happens now** (selection, scoring, simulation, outcome resolution). A behavior is reusable: the same definition ("Steal lunch") is selectable by many agents under different motivations (resentment, jealousy, revenge, boredom) — the behavior is constant, the motivation varies.
```jsonc
[
  { "id": "steal_lunch", "displayName": "Steal lunch",
    "category": "productivity|social|territorial|coping|escalation",
    "description": "Takes another employee's lunch from the break room.",
    "requiredContext": ["break_room", "target_employee", "manager_absent"],  // situational tokens the sim matches
    "requiredAffordances": ["lunch"],                                         // objects/resources the sim binds to props
    "pressureWeights": { "resentment": 3, "jealousy": 2, "spite": 2 },        // relative PULL per pressure (not a trigger)
    "traitModifiers": { "rule_bender": 2, "rule_follower": -3 },              // trait ids (§3.6) → signed nudge
    "relationshipRequirements": {
      "requiresTarget": true,           // does it act on another employee?
      "targetKnown": false,             // must the actor already know the target?
      "relationshipTypeAnyOf": [] },    // optional: only toward these bond-type ids (§3.7); empty = any
    "visibility": "private|semi-private|public",   // how observable — sim weights social fallout
    "severity": "trivial|minor|moderate|major|severe",
    "outcomes": ["target_annoyed", "trust_loss", "gossip_seed"] }            // EXPECTED consequences (sim resolves actuals)
]
```
`pressureWeights` / `traitModifiers` keys, `requiredContext` / `requiredAffordances`, and `outcomes` are **free-text-with-fallback** (the tool ships curated suggestion vocabularies, but the sim's pressure/context/affordance/outcome model is authoritative — unknown tokens fall back + log, §7). `traitModifiers` keys SHOULD resolve to the trait catalog (§3.6) and `relationshipTypeAnyOf` to the relationship-type catalog (§3.7) — the tool warns on a dangling id but never blocks. The catalog is exported **verbatim**; behaviors are not referenced by id from personas (the sim selects them at runtime), so there are no back-references. Shipped at the bundle root and in each scenario package. The default project ships ~28 behaviors across all five categories so a plain export gives the sim a complete behavior vocabulary to test against.

### 3.15 `symbol-registry.json` (register resolution for every symbol id) — project-level
The register constitution (`docs/register-constitution.md`) made data: every symbol id shipped anywhere in the bundle, resolved to **who is speaking**. The tool authors the assignments (they are per-id design decisions, versioned in [src/core/registry.ts](src/core/registry.ts)); the sim **reads** them — it selects symbols at runtime as before, but may not move an id across registers, and its UI can resolve register/provenance without duplicating these decisions.
```jsonc
{ "kind": "symbol-registry",
  "schema": "register-constitution.md",
  "registers": {                                   // the three narrators + how each fails (Article I/II)
    "truth": { "speaks": "what bodies leak",             "fails": "ambiguity" },
    "human": { "speaks": "what people choose to say",    "fails": "spin" },
    "iris":  { "speaks": "what the corporation claims",  "fails": "systematic-error" } },
  "rules": { "noUnregisteredSpeech": true,         // every exported id appears below (CI-enforced tool-side)
             "provenanceRequiredFor": "iris signals",
             "registersMayDisagree": true },       // the UI must never resolve a disagreement for the player
  "symbols": [
    { "id": "embarrassment", "family": "emotion-glyph", "carrier": "emotion-glyphs-atlas",
      "register": "truth", "kind": "signal" },
    { "id": "state-emotion-embarrassment", "family": "state-icon", "carrier": "icons-manifest",
      "register": "iris", "kind": "signal", "provenance": "inferred",
      "mirrors": "emotion-glyph/embarrassment" },  // the sanctioned lane for staged truth↔IRIS disagreement
    { "id": "reaction-eyes", "family": "reaction", "carrier": "icons-manifest",
      "register": "human", "kind": "signal" } ] }
```
Key semantics: **`kind`** — `signal` narrates the office's live state; `chrome` is workstation furniture (buttons, window controls, app marks) and never carries provenance. **`provenance`** (IRIS signals only, Article IV.4) — `measured` (IRIS's own bookkeeping: directives, readings, metrics, detected events), `inferred` (claims about inner/social states: emotions, needs, pressures, relationships, `harvestable`), `asserted` (reserved; no shipped id uses it yet). **`mirrors`** — the same vocabulary word in another carrier/register as `"<family>/<id>"`; when the sim wants IRIS to be *wrong*, it shows one sibling on the floor and the other in the chrome, and the link is how it knows it is lying. Notable assignment: the attention-puff family **splits** — `attn-emotion-spike`/`attn-conflict`/`attn-information` are truth (the floor leaking "this just changed"), `attn-harvestable` is IRIS/`inferred` (a corporate valuation; no body leaks "harvestable"). The `reaction-*` icons are the human register's full current membership (quoted Slack speech, always `literal` — the chrome never tints another narrator's voice).

### 3.16 Poses + the beat-schedule boundary (`pose-catalog.json`, per-character pose sheets)
The Social Theater pipeline's data layer (docs/social-theater-presentation-experiment.md Appendix B/C; constitutional law in docs/performance-direction-contract.md). Three layers, three owners — the boundary is the deliverable:

- **Tool (this repo):** the pose **vocabulary** — 8 held states (`neutral`, `walk-approach`, `notice`, `arms-crossed`, `hands-on-hips`, `point`, `slump`, `walk-away`), each with reads-as, the **presence channels** (§5.8) that shape its blocking, and lerpable **transform hints** (`headTiltDeg`/`headDropY`/`bodyLeanDeg` — group transforms, not frame animation). Art ships per character as full posed frames keyed `<pose>_<facing>` plus the `shoulderLeft`/`shoulderRight`/`hip` rig anchors.
- **Sim Director:** **sequencing** — beat schedules, dwell times, blocking, orientation, and the presence-signature modulation (this M plants closer; that E hesitates before withdrawing). None of that data is **exported**, by design: a beat schedule in the bundle is a boundary violation. (The tool's scene-reading preview harness keeps canned beat scripts as **non-normative fixtures** — the experiment rig of docs/social-theater-presentation-experiment.md — and they never ship.)
- **Renderer:** `pose · orientation · hold · move` — it draws the named held state and knows nothing else (no "reprimand", no "beat"). This is what keeps the renderer swappable (2D silhouettes vs. a 3D backend consume the same vocabulary; the presentation experiment's Build C depends on it).

```jsonc
// pose-catalog.json
{ "kind": "pose-catalog",
  "boundary": { "tool": "...vocabulary...", "director": "...sequencing is sim-side...", "renderer": "pose · orientation · hold · move" },
  "poses": [
    { "id": "point", "label": "Point", "readsAs": "the accusation (key beat)",
      "presenceChannels": ["expressiveness"], "transforms": {} },
    { "id": "slump", "label": "Slump", "readsAs": "submission / withdrawal",
      "presenceChannels": ["commitment", "latency", "postureSlump"],
      "transforms": { "headDropY": 7, "headTiltDeg": 6 } } ] }
```
A pose is a **sim-selected state** (register: `truth` — the body's own posture, §3.15), never stored in the recipe. Unknown pose ids fall back to `neutral` (free-text-with-fallback, §7). West is mirrored east; south/north `point` extends to the viewer's right, so the Director orients the agent (or uses west) to aim the arm. `bodyLeanDeg` renders on east/west only (a profile lean; on south/north it would read as a sideways topple).

### 3.17 Renderings (operational unit, corporate identity, human presence)
Register-constitution.md Article VIII (as amended 2026-07-02): **there is no canonical image of an employee — only renderings, each with an author.** The recipe is the IDENTITY; renderings are how each author draws it. The law both repos enforce: *every register redraws the person; none may rewrite their behavior* — a rendering is a pigment/framing choice, and conduct (pose, beat, approach, hesitation) passes through every rendering undistorted.

| Rendering | Author | Artifact | Consumer surface |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Operational unit** | IRIS | **Floor (Option B):** `character-layers/<id>/unit-layers@Nx.png` + `unit-manifest@Nx.json` — a sibling **layer atlas** the runtime composer renders exactly like the warm one (coding hue baked into its `palette`, `meta.rendering: "operational-unit"`, no mood layers). **Baked fallback:** `unit@Nx.png` + `unit-atlas@Nx.json` (+ `unit-poses@`). Spec in `recipe.json#renderings.unit`. | the floor. A **pictogram** — flat coding hue (identity's outfit hue, normalized; cold ≠ grey, cold = category coding), featureless `UNIT_INK` head disc, no face (feelings arrive as IRIS claims, never on the head). NOT producible by re-tinting the warm masks — it is its own drawing, shipped as its own atlas so the sim swaps atlas, not render path. |
| **Corporate identity** | the corporation | `portrait@Nx.png` | inspector, dossier, employee directory — the badge photo. |
| **Human presence** | the person | *(deferred)* | Slack avatar. Avatar CHOICE is persona-derived characterization (the dog photo, the default grey silhouette) — a design surface, not a palette transform; ships with the Slack-side work. |
| **Reality** | no one | — | never rendered, by law. |

Rules the sim must keep: renderings are **never visually unified** (no badge photo on the floor, no floor-unit in Slack — id-level selection linkage is fine); the **warm floor artifacts** (`sheet`, `moods`, `poses`) remain exported as the identity's own pigment — which floor rendering the sim displays is a sim-side presentation choice, but the shipped default intent is `unit`. Which artifact set the floor consumes (baked `unit` sheets vs. layer-compositor + `renderings.unit`) is the sim's call per its existing pipeline.

### 3.18 The build site & the construction crew (B1.5)

The re-direction makes the core verb *build*: a new game starts as a bare parking lot the player raises the office onto. Two Terrarium-side ingredients feed that (the sim owns import, generation, and the crew simulation — repo boundary §3 of the build spec).

**Outdoor ground — a DISTINCT kind (decision D2).** Grass / dirt / asphalt / sidewalk ship as ground, **not** interior floor. They use the same flat, seamless 128-unit tile machinery (they *are* `FloorTemplate`s, rendered by `composeFloorTile`), but they are exported into their own `ground/<id>/` folder with a distinct **`kind:"ground"`** atlas that carries the ground **sort band (`-20000`, below the floor band)**. This is what lets the sim's `ImportGround` (its story A-S1) import ground as its own layer — drawn under the interior floor and everything else — and keep it **un-paintable as interior floor** and free to receive its own clinical-drain treatment. Directory parity with floors: the sim discovers ground the same way it discovers floors (iterate the folder, read each per-tile atlas + `ground.json`), so there is no separate manifest. Ground ships a re-tintable layer atlas too (`kind:"ground-layers"`). Ids: `ground-grass`, `ground-dirt`, `ground-asphalt`, `ground-sidewalk`. Ground is **generated-only** (not player-painted, per the build spec §9), so there is no ground editor — it is a code-owned default the export always ships, lensed by the project LOOK like the floors.

**Cars + lot decals.** `car` / `car-suv` (plan-projected, `gridFootprint ~{w:4,h:2}`) and a `parking-line` bay decal (`{w:2,h:2}`) are exterior **decor** — they ride the normal `props/` folder + `office-layout.json` props, but are **non-placeable** (`NON_PLACEABLE_TEMPLATES`), so they never appear in the facility catalog / build palette (mirrors the building-surround ring props). Each ships a default instance so the lot reads as a lot.

**Construction persona (decision D4).** A `construction-worker` recipe (hi-vis vest outfit `outfit-hi-vis` + hard-hat accessory `acc-hard-hat`, on a hi-vis palette) the sim spawns the build crew from. It is an **authored persona**, deliberately **NOT** a fifth fixed default-cast agent id — that would trip the four-hero agent-id lockstep (`contract.test.ts`) and freeze crew size. So it ships as a code-owned ingredient in its own `construction-crew/<id>/` folder, decoupled from the editable office cast (never seated at a desk, never in the org chart). It carries the binder essentials — baked `sheet`+`atlas`, the mood-overlay atlas, the re-tintable layer atlas (`manifest`, the NPC composer's input) + IRIS's `unit-layers` rendering — plus `recipe.json` and `profile.json`, so `SpriteToolkitOfficeBinder.SyncAgentNpcs` binds a crew agent (`characterConfigId: "construction-worker"`) exactly as it binds any NPC. The sim sizes the crew dynamically (2–4) from this one template.

## 4. Formulas computed **in the tool** (authoritative)

These run in `applyDerived` before export ([src/core/profile.ts](src/core/profile.ts)). Authored overrides win; otherwise the value is derived. Helpers: `avg(...)` = arithmetic mean; `clampUnit` = clamp to `0–100`. All inputs are `0–100`.

```
temper          = clamp( 0.6·neuroticism + 0.4·(100 − agreeableness) )
grudgeHolding   = clamp( 0.6·(100 − agreeableness) + 0.4·neuroticism )

confront        = avg( extraversion, 100 − agreeableness, temper )
gossip          = avg( 100 − discretion, extraversion )
withdraw        = avg( neuroticism, 100 − extraversion )
verify          = avg( conscientiousness, integrity )
reassure        = avg( agreeableness, extraversion )
escalate        = avg( ambition, conscientiousness )
ignore          = avg( 100 − extraversion, 100 − neuroticism )

volatility      = avg( neuroticism, temper )

# presence — physical-expression dispositions (§3.2). Starting heuristics, tunable.
gaitSpeed       = avg( extraversion, ambition )
gaitControl     = avg( conscientiousness, 100 − neuroticism )
restlessness    = avg( neuroticism, extraversion, 100 − conscientiousness )
personalSpace   = avg( 100 − agreeableness, 100 − extraversion, neuroticism )
expressiveness  = avg( extraversion, openness, 100 − neuroticism )
commitment      = avg( 100 − neuroticism, conscientiousness, ambition )
latency         = avg( neuroticism, 100 − extraversion )
attentiveness   = avg( openness, extraversion )
```

Inputs are **only** OCEAN + the four primary game axes (ambition, integrity, loyalty, discretion). **Drives, trait tags, needs, preferences, skills, and objectives feed nothing here** — they are authored → exported, and given meaning by the sim. The presence block is the physical-expression sibling of the reaction tendencies: same derive-then-author-sticky pattern, resolved to plain numbers on export, never re-derived by the sim.

---

## 5. Formulas the **sim** owns (design sketch — NOT implemented here)

This section is the point of the doc: deciding these tells us what to capture in the tool. Treat everything below as **proposed/TBD** until the Unity side commits.

### 5.1 Drives → behavior
Drives are now a **structured, reusable catalog** (`drives.json`, §3.5) that personas reference by id. Each drive carries `amplifiesNeeds` — the tool-authored coupling the sim acts on. Resolution the sim owns:
- Look up the persona's `drives.primary`/`secondary` ids in the catalog. `primary` should weigh heavier than `secondary` (e.g. 2:1).
- A drive raises motivation pressure on its `amplifiesNeeds` (combine with §5.2 need depletion).
- `objectives[]` gate/scope drives to a concern: `{ sourceDrive, targetOrConcern, expectedBehaviorTendency, status }` — only `status:"active"` objectives apply; `expectedBehaviorTendency` is the predicted action when the concern is salient.
- **Unknown id discipline:** a persona may reference a drive id absent from the catalog (a one-off). The sim should fallback + log, never hard-fail.

**Still sim-owned:** action *selection* from drive pressure, and any per-drive reaction bias beyond the need coupling (we deliberately did not author reaction weights per drive — that would overlap the spine-derived reaction tendencies in §4).

### 5.2 Needs depletion / pressure
`needs[id] = { baseline, sensitivity }`. Sketch: satisfaction starts at `baseline`, depletes over time scaled by `sensitivity`, and the most-deprived need (optionally weighted by active drives, §5.1) sets current motivation. The tool already surfaces "top needs" by `sensitivity` for preview only.

### 5.3 Reaction selection
On an event, the sim picks among the 7 `reactionTendencies` (already numeric, §4) — likely a weighted/softmax draw, modulated by `temperament.volatility`, current mood, and the triggering relationship. **Trait biases (§3.6) apply here:** for each trait the persona carries, add its `biasesReactions` nudges (scaled) to the corresponding tendencies before selecting. **Relationship-type biases (§3.7) also apply here when there's a triggering relationship:** look up the edge's `relationshipType` in the catalog and add its `biasesReactions` (toward-the-target nudges) the same way — this is what makes a character react *differently to different people*. Tool provides the base tendencies + trait nudges + relationship-type nudges; sim provides the combine + selection rule.

### 5.4 Relationship dynamics
`relationships[]` (resolved baseline + overrides) are the **starting** edges; each carries a `relationshipType` id (§3.7) and an optional `secret` flag. The sim evolves the edges over the run (trust/suspicion/affinity/influence/respect/familiarity drift from interactions, gated by `grudgeHolding` for how long slights persist). **Third-party / jealousy is sim-owned behavior the tool feeds:** when agent B (the target of A's `romance`/`mentor`/… edge) interacts with a third agent C, the sim looks up that edge's relationship type, and if it carries a `thirdParty` coupling, biases A's reaction by `thirdParty.biasesReactions` scaled by `sensitivity` — scaled up further when `intensifiesTowardDisliked` and A regards C negatively (low affinity / rival). Example: Linda has a secret `romance` edge → Carl; Carl talks to Janice (whom Linda is cool on) → Linda's jealousy fires, intensified. Tool ships the start edges + the typed coupling; sim owns the drift model and the triangular evaluation.

### 5.5 Belief & information propagation
`beliefs.json` (per-agent stance+confidence) and `knowledge.json` (truths, information items, who-knows-what) are start state. The sim owns spread: who shares with whom (gated by `gossip` tendency, `discretion`, affinity, `accessState` of shared locations), and how `truthAlignment`/`originType` shift a receiver's `confidence`/`stance`.

### 5.6 Objective / KPI scoring
`objective.kpi` + `expectedEvidence[]` + the active `variant`'s `selections` define what a run is measured against. The sim owns the measurement; the tool owns the definition. KPI strings are free-text — same registry/fallback discipline as drives.

### 5.7 Scenario-template casting (one synchronized contract — tool exports, sim casts)
The full-game direction has the **engine cast templates at runtime** — bind a cast-agnostic `scenario-template.json` (§3.8) onto the live cast/office by precondition match. The **tool** does this at authoring time (`castTemplate` in `scenarioTemplate.ts`: greedy-best-with-backtracking over the precondition vocabulary, strongest-fit wins ties; required roles must fill or the cast fails; optional roles skip) and exports the resulting **bound** `scenario.json` — so **the prototype loader is unchanged**. **As of F4.1 the template library is also exported** (`scenario-template.json`, §3.8), so the sim's runtime caster ("Scenario Loading" epic — E30 generalize / E34) has its input artifact:
- the input artifact `scenario-template.json` ships beside today's bound `scenario.json`;
- the sim gains a **runtime caster** = the port of `castTemplate`, **the same precondition vocabulary (§3.8) — one contract, two evaluators**, evaluating against **live** persona + relationship + department/org-distance + **real spatial proximity** (the conditions the sim does better than the tool's authoring-time proxies — `familiarity` for proximity, and the `spatial` `distance` source which the tool only resolves when a scene is present while the sim has live positions);
- a bound `scenario.json` keeps loading as-is — it is the already-cast special case (single-candidate roles).

**Validation parity / drift check.** The precondition vocabulary in §3.8 is the single source of truth both casters implement; `validateScenarioTemplate` is the tool-side authoring gate and the sim's loader runs the equivalent structural check on ingest. The **shared fixture** is the exported library itself — `THE_OFFICE_ROMANCE` round-tripped through both casters against the same cast must produce the same role→agent assignment; a divergence is a contract drift. (The bound-`scenario.json` path obligates no sim change to ship tool work.)

### 5.8 Presence realization (the body layer — design sketch, NOT implemented here)

`profile.json.presence` (§3.2) is a set of **dispositions**, not animations — 0–100 numbers that say *how* a body occupies space, never *what* it does or *when*. **Recipe answers _what do I look like?_, persona answers _why do I do things?_, and presence answers _how does my internal state leak into the physical world?_** — presence is the **physical manifestation of persona**, a complete layer alongside recipe and persona. Recipe/persona/presence are **priors over a person**; the sim is the world that **samples** them.

> **Where derivation runs (2026-06-29):** persona generation has migrated into the sim, so presence — the physical sibling of the spine — is **derived in the sim's `PersonaGenerator`** for generated agents (the formulas below in §4 are the authoritative spec it mirrors, the same way the reaction tendencies are). Terrarium is now mostly an art-asset supplier; it derives/exports presence only for the legacy hand-authored import path. `gaitSpeed` → walk pace is wired end-to-end sim-side (The Water Cooler `SPRITE_INTEGRATION.md` §W6.1).

**What presence is NOT responsible for:** animation clips/states/trees, blend trees, rigs, IK, bone data, frame indices, or framerate-bound ms. Those belong to the **Director** (sequencing/timing) and **Presentation** (the renderer — sprites today, anything tomorrow) layers that consume presence. Presence owns only the *behavioral constraints* every presentation layer expresses in its own way; swap the renderer and presence survives unchanged. The runtime pipeline: **Simulation → Presence (`Profile ⊕ current-mood` = the resolved *state*) → Director → Presentation → Actor.** What the sim owns:

- **Curves & timing.** Presence channels are renderer-agnostic intent (cf. the badge motion-intent vocabulary, §3.9). The sim maps each number onto its actual rig: `gaitSpeed`→locomotion rate, `gaitControl`→start/stop easing, `restlessness`→idle micro-motion amplitude, `expressiveness`→gesture frequency/size, `attentiveness`→head-turn-to-notice. A channel whose rig anchor a pack doesn't expose simply goes **dormant** — no error.
- **Two registers.** *Steady-state* (gait/restlessness/personalSpace/expressiveness) is always-on; *transition signatures* (commitment/latency/attentiveness) fire at the **seams between sim events** the sim already raises — `conversation-ended`, `path-arrived`, `agent-passed-within-N`. Presence decorates those gaps; it does not invent events.
- **Per-mood modulation — `profile.json.presenceMoods` (§3.2).** Current mood is sim-owned; this per-character map answers *how this body expresses it*. Keyed by **mood** (the shared §3.9 vocabulary — `suspicious/curious/defensive/hostile/confused`; `normal` is the baseline and never appears), each entry is a sparse set of **bipolar deltas** (−100..100) over the resolved baseline `presence`. **The sim adds the current mood's deltas to the baseline presence** before realizing motion (clamp to 0–100). The map is per-character on purpose: one body paces when hostile (`restlessness +20`), another freezes (`restlessness −20`) — same mood, opposite delta. Optional + sparse: **absent ⇒ apply no modulation** (the body expresses every mood the same way). If the sim's internal emotion model is richer than the six moods, it maps emotion → mood (which it already does to pick the overlay) and reuses that key — no new vocabulary.
- **Pairwise resolution is sim-owned.** When two bodies meet, **neither `personalSpace` "wins" in the tool** — each profile authors a *preference*; the sim resolves the staged distance from the pair (situational ⇒ a verb ⇒ sim's). The tool never authors "the gap between Bob and Linda."
- **⚠️ Non-progress motion is legal — the pathfinder must not scrub it.** Low `commitment` means a body may **start a motion, stop, turn back, and resume** (second-guessing); high `latency` means it **pauses/lingers** before acting. These produce frames where the agent is *not progressing toward its goal* and may briefly move *away* from it. **The sim must treat dithering, hesitation, and lingering as expression, not as a failed/abandoned action** — i.e. presence may add non-progress motion without invalidating the sim's chosen action. If pathfinding "corrects" the body straight back onto its path, the most human behavior (the "Carl" signature) is erased. This is the one presence channel that needs explicit sim buy-in before consumption.

**Recommended first integration:** prove **one steady-state channel end-to-end** (`gaitSpeed` → locomotion rate) — cheapest, most visible at zoom — before wiring transition signatures or the commitment/dithering loop. See docs/presence-profile.md.

## 6. Open data-capture questions

Things the sim will likely need that the tool does **not** capture yet — decide before building the sim side:

1. ~~Drive semantics location~~ — **Resolved:** drives are a tool-authored structured catalog with a `amplifiesNeeds` coupling (§3.5/§5.1). Sub-question ~~per-drive reaction biases~~ — **Resolved (sim, 2026-06-15):** no per-drive reaction biases are authored; reaction shaping comes from trait + relationship-type `biasesReactions` only (need coupling is enough). See `persona_consumption_model.md`.
2. ~~KPI/objective evaluators~~ — **Resolved (2026-06-15):** `kpi` stays **free-form**. The sim keeps a registry of implemented evaluators (fallback+log on unknown, same discipline as drives/traits); the tool surfaces an authoring-time **"unknown KPI" warning** when a `kpi` id has no sim evaluator (non-breaking, like drive/trait autocomplete). No closed enum, no lockstep release. See `persona_consumption_model.md` Layer 7.
3. **Location/activity vocabularies** — `routine[].locationId/activity` and scenario `locationId`s are free-text; the sim owns the real set. `activity` now also drives the overhead **activity badge** (§3.9): the badged set (`work/talking/meeting/break/lunch/idle/walk/monitoring`) is the recommended vocabulary, fed from the same list as routine autocomplete so the two can't drift, but still free-text with fallback (an unbadged activity just draws no badge). Open: do we want the tool to validate routine `locationId`s against the scenario's declared locations?
4. ~~Time model~~ — **Resolved (sim, 2026-06-15):** the sim owns time via the Epic 20 compressed office-day clock; routine `"HH:MM"` maps onto it and needs deplete per step. The tool still does not model time — and does not need to. See `persona_consumption_model.md` Layer 1.
5. ~~Need ↔ drive coupling~~ — **Resolved:** it is tool data — `drives.json[].amplifiesNeeds` (§3.5). The activity→need *replenishment* map (a different mapping) is **sim-coded**, not exported (decided 2026-06-15).
6. ~~Scenario-template cast-coverage gate~~ — **Resolved (F3.5):** the tool checks a generated org against the scenario-template library (`ROLE_TEMPLATES`) before export, reusing the per-template `analyzeTemplateCoverage` path. `analyzeOrgCoverage(library, cast)` aggregates a castable ratio + named gaps (`scenarioTemplate.ts`); `validateOrgScenarioCoverage` returns the same `{ errors, warnings }` shape as `validateOrgStructure` (§3.11). **Warn vs. block:** the export **hard-blocks** only when the cast can play *nothing* (castable ratio ≤ `blockAtOrBelow`, default 0 — shipping an org that generates no scenarios is the only true error) and **warns + confirms** when coverage is merely thin (ratio < `warnBelow`, default 0.5), naming the under-covered templates and the required roles that cannot fill. Both thresholds are tunable; a sprite-only export with no personas skips the gate. This is a tool-side authoring guard — it changes no exported artifact shape and obligates no sim change. **F4.4** extends the analysis to the department/distance vocabulary (§3.8): `analyzeTemplateCoverage` already *evaluates* department/`crossDepartment`/`distance` preconditions (it casts the template), and now **names the specific unmet condition** behind a blocked required role — a missing department (`requires department "legal", which has no members`), an unsatisfiable cross-wing pairing (`must be in a different department from "rivalB"…`), or an unreachable distance threshold (`requires organizational distance gte 90 from "a"…`). These reasons ride on `RoleCoverage.unmetReasons` / `TemplateGap.reasons` and flow into the gate's message. Spatial-distance gaps aren't diagnosed at coverage time (no office scene); structural distance is.
7. ~~Department capability/medium tags (E2 F2.4)~~ — **Resolved + BUILT (2026-06-20).** *Capability-mapping home (S2.4.1):* **Terrarium-side** — per-department capability/medium tags are authored data the tool owns (a department property like `category`/`subculture`), while the **clearance/medium model that consumes them stays sim-owned** (matches the established split; per-department tags allow per-company variation a uniform sim rule can't). *Data shape:* confirmed against the game-design-docs surveillance/clearance model (`surveillance_and_clearance_model.md` + `14_OFFICE_SCALE_DIRECTION.md`, which keep capability **tags** tool-side but capability **semantics + reach/access gating** sim-side) → **flat free-text medium ids** `capabilities?: string[]`, NOT an access-tiered shape (the access/temporal axis is the clearance ladder's, sim-owned). Built (S2.4.2): optional `capabilities?` on `DepartmentDefinition` (§3.10), seeded by category via `CATEGORY_CAPABILITIES`/`defaultCapabilitiesForCategory` (so cascade-generated orgs are surveillance-ready, overridable per department), surfaced in the **visible** half of `org-structure.json` (§3.11) and carried verbatim in `departments.json`, editable in the Departments panel. Free-text + fallback (suggested vocab `DEPARTMENT_CAPABILITIES`); absent-safe; the exact medium table stays open sim-side (E38 consumer, behind the Build 0.4 gate).

## 7. Compatibility rules

- **Adding** a suggestion to a free-text vocabulary (drive, trait tag, KPI, location, activity) is **non-breaking** — it only affects authoring autocomplete, never validation or export shape. **Adding an activity badge** is likewise non-breaking: a new shared-atlas cell the sim shows for that `activity` or ignores (§3.9).
- **Version gating:** `profile.json`, `scenario.json`, and `scenario-template.json` carry `meta.schemaVersion` (currently **12**, the project schema version — v10 added the `departments.json` catalog §3.10 + the derived `org-structure.json` §3.11; v11 made persona `identity.department` a department-catalog **id**, mutable for the sim's transfer tier; v12 added the optional `company` root §3.12 — additive, so a pre-v12 project just has no company). `office-layout.json` carries its **own** payload version (now **3** — v2 added `rooms[].departmentId` + the `wings[]` block; v3 added the `connectivity[]` wing-adjacency graph, §3.4); every addition is additive, so the bumps are non-breaking. The sim version-gates on these — `scenario.json` gates a whole scenario package (the bundled `drives.json`/`traits.json`/`departments.json`/`org-structure.json` are resolved within that already-versioned context); `profile.json` gates the per-character visual-import path. Bare-array catalogs (and the derived `org-structure.json`) are intentionally unversioned — they never travel without a versioned `scenario.json` or `project.json`.
- **Renaming/removing a field** in §3 **is** breaking — bump `CURRENT_SCHEMA_VERSION` (which flows into `meta.schemaVersion`), add a migration step, and update the sim loader.
- The sim should **fallback + log**, never hard-fail, on an unrecognized free-text id (drive, KPI, activity). That tolerance is what lets the tool ship a richer vocabulary without lockstep sim releases.
